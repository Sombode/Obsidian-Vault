# Revenue

Money coming in from selling. Opposed to *expenditures* (money going out).

*Total Revenue* ($TR$)  - Total income from selling a given level; rectangle ($P \cdot Q$)
*Average Revenue* ($AR$) - "Per unit" revenue at a given level; line segment ($\frac{TR}{Q}$)
*Marginal Revenue* ($MR$) - Change in total input from one level to another; derivative ($\frac{\Delta TR}{\Delta Q}$)

$$Demand = AR = P$$

# Profit

Money gained (revenue minus expenditure).

*Total Profit* ($T\Pi$) - Difference between TR and TC at a given output (Q); $TR-TC$ or $Q \cdot A\Pi$ 
*Average Profit* ($A\Pi$) - Profit the firms recieves per unit at a given output; $\frac{T\Pi}{Q}$ or $AR-ATC$ or $P-ATC$
*Marginal Profit* ($M\Pi$) - Change in total profit from selling another unit; $\frac{\Delta T\Pi}{\Delta Q}$ or $MR-MC$

When:
- $MR>MC$:  $M\Pi > 0; T\Pi \uparrow$
- $MR=MC$:  $M\Pi = 0; T\Pi$ peaks
- $MR<MC$:  $M\Pi < 0; T\Pi \downarrow$

# Key Rules for Firms

- Produce where $MR=MC$
- Price is on the Demand Curve at the optimal output level
- Shut down if $TR<TVC$ ($AR<AVC=MC$)
