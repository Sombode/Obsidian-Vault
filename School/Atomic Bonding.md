# Bonding
When a number of atoms combine in a **stable** association.

Generally bonds are stable when all atoms have a stable octet (except for hydrogen, since it has a psuedo-octet)

All bonds contain an electrostatic force of attraction between positive and negative parts of atoms/molecules.

# Intermolecular Bonding
Bonds that occur outside/between particles (molecule-to-molecule/atom-to-atom). 

Caused by the interaction of **partial** charges. Weaker than intramolecular bonding.
	ex. Hydrogen bonds, Metallic bonds, Dispersion forces, Dipole-Dipole

# Intramolecular Bonding
Bonds that occur within the particle (molecule/crystal lattice).
	ex. Ionic bonds, Covalent bonds

# Ionic Bond
The bonding of oppositely charged atoms based on a transfer of electron.
Occurs between a metal ion (cation) and nonmetal ion (anion).

Forms a crystal lattice and hard (due to quantity), (typically) solid substances.
High melting point (>300 °C) and boiling point (difficult to phase change).
Low vapor pressure/volatility (will not easily turn into a gas over time).
High heat of fusion.

Generally easy to dissolve in water (is also a good electrolyte).
Good conductor in liquid/aqueous form.
	ex. $NaCl$, $CuSO_4$

# Covalent Bond
The bonding of atoms by the sharing of electrons between their nuclei.
Comprised of nonmetals sharing electrons.

Forms molecules and softer, brittle, (typically) liquid/gaseous substances.
Low melting point (<300 °C) and boiling point.
High vapor pressure (easily converts to gas/liquid).

Variable water solubility (also is a poor electrolyte).
Nonconductor in liquid/aqueous form.
	ex. $H_2O$, $CO_2$

# Electrolyte
A substance that conducts electricity when the substance is in liquid (molten/melted) or aqueous (dissolved) form.
	ex. Ionic compounds (Salts, Acids, Bases)

# Metallic Bonding
Electrons free themselves from any one atom and move around.
