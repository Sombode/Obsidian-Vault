> Appeal to ethics; Arguments of character


Ethos relies on the character of the author to support their argument, whether that be their authority on a subject from experience or expertise, or their past credibility.

Throughout their argument, authors portray themselves in a specific way based on the language they use, and the type of person they depict themselves as plays a large role in how strong their ethos is. Those identifying with certain job titles or institutions, or describing past experience in the topic at hand build their authority in the argument.

The author's credibility in an argument, or how trustworthy they are, stems form a mix of their authority, past character/credibility, and language. Respecting the reader and qualifying their own character/argument are strong methods of building credibility.

Generally, understanding the author's underlying motivations and loyalties can discredit their claim, as they might be biased toward one side for specific reasons. However, authors that are transparent about their motivations can become more credible to readers.
