Arguments work most effectively when they resonate with their audience, but achieving such an effect becomes difficult as unintended audiences are introduced.

*Intended/Ideal readers*  are audience that the writer of an argument imagines or tailors their writing toward, existing and staying at the forefront of their mind as they shape their argument.

*Invoked readers* are the audience directly represented in the text, generally with the text mentioning "you" or other people in the audience directly inside of it. Rather than the audience in the writer's head, invoked readers are the audience in the argument itself.

*Real readers* are the actual audience reading an argument, whether they are the intended readers or not.

Some arguments are tailored specifically toward a certain group of people the writer identifies with, with them using collective pronouns such as "we" and "us" in the argument. While this can build strong connections and pull with the ideal readers, other real readers outside of this group become highly isolated and the argument might lose much of its impact on them.
