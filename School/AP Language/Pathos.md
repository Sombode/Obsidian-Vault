> Appeal to passion; Arguments of emotion

Leveraging emotions is a powerful way to influence people's thoughts, sometimes bypassing conventional logic. They excel at producing strong results, and thus are better at persuading the audience to action than other methods. 

Emotions can also be used to build connections between the writer and audience, by showing how the writer "feels their pain" or vice-versa in describing situations of struggle. Some authors try to make them seem as fair-minded or neutral on a topic as possible, sometimes even claiming that they used to be of another opinion but changed. This in turns builds credibility with the audience and thus employs some [[Ethos]].

Humor is an especially effective way to leverage emotions. Laughter can disarm the audience and have them put aside their normal reservations on a topic, along with allowing the author to touch on more sensitive topics more easily. However, humor can be malicious when it is used as ridicule, focusing and demeaning an individual by pointing humor at them.
