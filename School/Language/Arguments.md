Arguments are designed to push a point or convey a message, and are nuanced in what they achieve and how. There are many different ways of classifying arguments.

## Purpose

*Arguments to convince* seek to set a fact straight in the audience's mind, creating conviction of the knowledge.

*Arguments to persuade* seek to push the audience toward action, exceeding the scope of arguments to convince.

*Rogerian arguments* seek common ground between the different perspectives, by understanding their points and trying to find a win-win situation.

*Arguments to inform* publicize information to the audience, vying to spread it to many people. This can be for the purpose of general welfare/safety (street signs) or advertising (acknowledging the existence of a product for consumers to be aware to buy it).

*Arguments to explore* seek to further understanding or discussion around a broader, philosophical topic (social, ethical...). There may be no clear opposition, and these arguments can argue for the existence of a problem in a certain area that needs to be addressed.

*Arguments to decide* weigh the pros and cons of different options to push one choice over the others, usually justifying the choice with its reasoning.

*Arguments to meditate/pray* seek internal modification of the writer or reader through use of poetic, detailed language to invoke deep thought and meditation on a topic.

## Time

Aristotle believed that time played a large part in how arguments should be interpreted, hence his classification of arguments based on the time period they focus on.

*Forensic arguments* discuss the past, generally seeking to validate information about it (events, facts). However, they can also have other purposes such as exploration (ex. "Should Columbus's explorations be celebrated?").

*Deliberative arguments* speculate about the future, suggesting what will or should happen in the future. Generally when suggesting a course of action for the future, they rely on past (forensic) evidence to support the viability of their plan.

*Ceremonial/epideictic arguments* discuss the present, usually its many societal, ethical, and cultural values. These are commonly found in public speeches such as inaugural addresses during ceremonies, hence the name.

## Statis Theory

Statis Theory comes from ancient Greek and Roman methods to classify arguments (in court cases) based on a set of sequential questions that build on each other, eventually leading to a better understanding of the status of an argument. These questions may vary, but usually are along the lines of:

1. Did something happen?
	- *Argument of Fact* 
	- "True/false" statement proved or disproved with evidence
	- Superficially simple, but becomes more complex as underlying axioms need to be established
2. What is its nature?
	- *Argument of Definition*
	- Arguments about relating or categorizing an object/action in a certain category
3. What is its quality?
	- *Argument of Evaluation*
	- Similar to arguments of definition, but now assigning more subjective adjectives to an object (ex. good, better, bad, worse)
4. What actions should be taken?
	- *Argument of Proposal*
	- Sets forth actions to be taken to address an issue
	- May have to first confirm the existence of the problem to address
	- May expand on and defend its solution
