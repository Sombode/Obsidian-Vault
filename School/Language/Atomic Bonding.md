*Bonding*
	When a number of atoms combine in a **stable** association.

Generally bonds are stable when all atoms have a stable octet (except for hydrogen, since it has a psuedo-octet)

All bonds contain an electrostatic force of attraction between positive and negative parts of atoms/molecules.

*Intermolecular Bonding*
	Bonds that occur outside/between particles (molecule-to-molecule/atom-to-atom). Caused by the interaction of **partial** charges.
	ex. Hydrogen bonds

*Intramolecular Bonding*
	Bonds that occur within the particle (molecule/crystal lattice).
	ex. Ionic and covalent bonds

*Ionic Bond*
	The bonding of oppositely charged atoms based on a transfer of electron.

*Covalent Bond*
	The bonding of atoms by the sharing of elec
