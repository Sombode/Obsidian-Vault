*Bonding*
	When a number of atoms combine in a **stable** association.

Generally bonds are stable when all atoms have a stable octet (except for hydrogen, since it has a psuedo-octet)

All bonds contain an electrostatic force of attraction between positive and negative parts of atoms/molecules.

*Intermolecular Bonding*
	Bonds that occur outside/between particles (molecule-to-molecule/atom-to-atom). Caused by the interaction of **partial** charges. Weaker than intramolecular bonding.
	ex. Hydrogen bonds, Metallic bonds, Dispersion forces, Dipole-Dipole

*Intramolecular Bonding*
	Bonds that occur within the particle (molecule/crystal lattice).
	ex. Ionic bonds, Covalent bonds

*Ionic Bond*
	The bonding of oppositely charged atoms based on a transfer of electron.
	Occurs between a metal ion (cation) and nonmetal ion (anion).
	Forms a crystal lattice and hard (due to quantity), (typically) solid substances.
	High melting point (300+ Â°C) and boiling point (difficult to phase change).
	Low vapor pressure/volatility (will not easily turn into a gas over time).
	High heat of fusion.
	Generally easy to dissolve in water (is also a good electrolyte).
	ex. $NaCl$, $CuSO_4$

*Covalent Bond*
	The bonding of atoms by the sharing of electrons between their nuclei.

*Metallic Bonding*
	Electrons free themselves from any one atom and move around
