# “The Need for a New, Clear Option: An In-Depth Analysis of Nuclear Energy”

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/26427280](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26427280)
## abstract/intro

- While nuclear power is hailed as a green solution to current energy issues, it may not be entirely viable/the best solution
- Nuclear disasters may not be entirely destructive towards human life, but they still have large economic expenses
- Nuclear policy by governments has been shown to be undemocratic and disproportionately affects certain groups
- Governments can be deliberately misleading and conceal information if it does not support nuclear power
- ? Check this

## section 2: process overview

- The CO2 emissions from mining and transporting uranium to fuel reactors per unit of energy produced by nuclear power is about the same as simply burning natural gas (Mary Olson, Nuclear Information and Resource Service)
- ? Check this
- Even still, a very large amount of reactors will be needed to properly address climate change; roughly a new one every two weeks (MIT 2003; Olson 2006)
- ? How does this stack up against other green energy solutions, such as solar, wind, and “artificial photosynthesis” (mentioned in the article as alternatives)
- The Fukushima disaster still has lasting consequences and produced harmful amounts of radiation (see Steven Starr, 2012)
- 23 US reactors today still use the same design as Fukushima (Starr)
- Roughly 13.3 million people were impacted by cesium contamination from the disaster (Starr; section 3.3)

## section 3: health/lifestyle benefits

- Section 3.1 uses definition!! (defines “quality-of-life” to examine how beneficial nuclear energy is; classifies into lifestyle and health benefits)
- Nuclear plant construction injects business and government subsidies into a community, providing jobs and buying materials
- However, little extra business is added to the community (as compared to other construction projects such as a mall) once construction is completed
- However, this sudden economic growth may increase rent/utilities for people who don’t see a corresponding increase in their own wage, ultimately harming the community financially
- Plant construction also has a variety of long term environmental detriments associated with it (deforestation, habitat destruction, waste runoff, noise/air pollution; McCally 2007)

## section 4: economy

- In part due to government subsidies and uranium’s energy density, nuclear energy is statistically shown to have lower energy costs than other sources
- Some of the higher costs of nuclear energy come from a push for more stringent safety regulations (especially after major accidents)
- It is acknowledged that the Fukushima Plant had an accident only after its lifespan was extended for 10 years past its initial 40 year run, indicating that human policy making could be to blame
- Japan also has other nuclear scandals (WNA, Nuclear Power in Japan)
- Some claim that nuclear energy will continue to expand as it is one of the best sources of low-carbon energy we have (Inhofe 2007, Hayashi and Hughes 2013) and will provide economic benefits to the regions it is used
- However, nuclear energy has large capital costs ($5+ billion according to McCally 2007) and mostly draws in unskilled laborers who become unemployed after construction is completed
- Nuclear reactors also end up being much more expensive than originally budgeted
- ? Check this
- The cost of power for nuclear energy is only really cheaper when taxes are levied to balance out carbon; even so price reductions are insignificant (only cents)
- Furthermore, cheaper electricity can lead to people being more wasteful with energy and paying/using more
- ? Check this
- The large costs associated with any nuclear incident heavily detracts from its economic appeal, with Fukushima costing $250-500 billion USD (Starr 2012)
- Contamination can also lead to property/land being permanently inaccessible as it is too dangerous to be near
- Contamination can quickly spread throughout an ecosystem, reaching crops and fish more than 200 miles away
- 733,000 curies of cesium entered the Pacific form Fukushima (Starr 2012), leading to contamination as far as California, with increased thyroid cancer rates in young children in many areas bordering the Pacific
- Most investors aren’t confident enough in nuclear energy’s profitability to invest, so most reactors rely on loans and tax dollar for funding
- ? Look into the Report of the Rasmussen group (Oct 1975), estimates of the worst possible reactor accident costing $60 billion USD in property damage
- Nuclear waste sites are also difficult to obtain (due to public resistance; it took 20 years for the Korean government to receive approval, see Jun et al. 2010)
- The author claims that the health/environmental risks associated with nuclear power greatly outweigh its meager economic potential

## section 5

- explores many possible energy generation methods, expansion of wind and development of artificial photosynthesis proposed

## meta notes

- The source appears and claims to be highly knowledgeable about the ins-and-outs of nuclear energy
- The source claims to strive to be unbiased, but seems to show preference against nuclear power (this is explicitly stated and addressed; claims that facts are inherently anti-nuclear)
- This was published in 2015, only 4 years after Fukushima (which is frequently mentioned/focused on)
- The source highly encourages readers to take the facts and come to their own conclusions (good superficially, but supplying readers with biased facts creates biased conclusions)
- Seems to advocate/promote development of artificial photosynthesis
- Decently respectable source list, some sources are repeated heavily

# “Elite Ideology and Risk Perception in Nuclear Energy Policy”

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1961958](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1961958)

- People are becoming more acutely aware of environmental risks (TMI?) and pollution, increasing media attention
- While before policy could be controlled by few elites (politicians, experts in the field), now there is much greater control
	- This can be a bad thing, as political activists/public interest groups hold more sway than the actual scientific experts ("The scientific establishment is far less influential than it once was;" (384) Cambridge Reports unpublished study)
- Policymaking is becoming stricter...
- ...due to the greater impacts we as a society have (we have the capacity to injure larger populations)
- ...due to our increased standards of living making us more risk-adverse (we expect better living, so we take steps to avoid risks)
- ...due to scientific advancement publishing more accurate findings on trace substances concentrations (more easily detected) and effects
- ...due to a cult involving the erosion of traditional American values????
- "\[B]usinessmen with financial and emotional commitments to new technologies find it very difficult to accept evidence of negative effects until such evidence becomes irrefutable" (384)
- 5 main claims/hypotheses of the article (385):
		**\1.** The relevant scientific community
		believes nuclear plants to be safe, and
		neither ideology nor economic self-
		interest plays a substantial role in their
		assessment.
		**\2.** Among other key leadership groups,
		by contrast, views about nuclear
		energy correlate with political ideology.
		**\3.** National media journalists are skep-
		tical about nuclear safety.
		**\4.** Journalists inaccurately report the
		views of the relevant scientific com-
		munity.
		**\5.** The views of other leadership groups
		on nuclear energy correlate highly with
		the news sources that they consider
		reliable.

## Nuclear Energy, Ideology, and the Perception of Risk

- Since the 1950s, U.S. support of nuclear energy has shifted from support to opposition (385)
- While economic factors influence some (political/business execs; plant abandonment and exceeding budget), most are worried about safety
- Table 1 is a survey of various figureheads on nuclear safety (386)

# meta notes

  - Old (June 1987), close to TMI
  - Look into Ralph Nader; the article kinda hates on him (public figure)
