# “The Need for a New, Clear Option: An In-Depth Analysis of Nuclear Energy”

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/26427280](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26427280)
## abstract/intro

- While nuclear power is hailed as a green solution to current energy issues, it may not be entirely viable/the best solution
- Nuclear disasters may not be entirely destructive towards human life, but they still have large economic expenses
- Nuclear policy by governments has been shown to be undemocratic and disproportionately affects certain groups
- Governments can be deliberately misleading and conceal information if it does not support nuclear power
- ? Check this

## section 2: process overview

- The CO2 emissions from mining and transporting uranium to fuel reactors per unit of energy produced by nuclear power is about the same as simply burning natural gas (Mary Olson, Nuclear Information and Resource Service)
- ? Check this
- Even still, a very large amount of reactors will be needed to properly address climate change; roughly a new one every two weeks (MIT 2003; Olson 2006)
- ? How does this stack up against other green energy solutions, such as solar, wind, and “artificial photosynthesis” (mentioned in the article as alternatives)
- The Fukushima disaster still has lasting consequences and produced harmful amounts of radiation (see Steven Starr, 2012)
- 23 US reactors today still use the same design as Fukushima (Starr)
- Roughly 13.3 million people were impacted by cesium contamination from the disaster (Starr; section 3.3)

## section 3: health/lifestyle benefits

- Section 3.1 uses definition!! (defines “quality-of-life” to examine how beneficial nuclear energy is; classifies into lifestyle and health benefits)
- Nuclear plant construction injects business and government subsidies into a community, providing jobs and buying materials
- However, little extra business is added to the community (as compared to other construction projects such as a mall) once construction is completed
- However, this sudden economic growth may increase rent/utilities for people who don’t see a corresponding increase in their own wage, ultimately harming the community financially
- Plant construction also has a variety of long term environmental detriments associated with it (deforestation, habitat destruction, waste runoff, noise/air pollution; McCally 2007)

## section 4: economy

- In part due to government subsidies and uranium’s energy density, nuclear energy is statistically shown to have lower energy costs than other sources
- Some of the higher costs of nuclear energy come from a push for more stringent safety regulations (especially after major accidents)
- It is acknowledged that the Fukushima Plant had an accident only after its lifespan was extended for 10 years past its initial 40 year run, indicating that human policy making could be to blame
- Japan also has other nuclear scandals (WNA, Nuclear Power in Japan)
- Some claim that nuclear energy will continue to expand as it is one of the best sources of low-carbon energy we have (Inhofe 2007, Hayashi and Hughes 2013) and will provide economic benefits to the regions it is used
- However, nuclear energy has large capital costs ($5+ billion according to McCally 2007) and mostly draws in unskilled laborers who become unemployed after construction is completed
- Nuclear reactors also end up being much more expensive than originally budgeted
- ? Check this
- The cost of power for nuclear energy is only really cheaper when taxes are levied to balance out carbon; even so price reductions are insignificant (only cents)
- Furthermore, cheaper electricity can lead to people being more wasteful with energy and paying/using more
- ? Check this
- The large costs associated with any nuclear incident heavily detracts from its economic appeal, with Fukushima costing $250-500 billion USD (Starr 2012)
- Contamination can also lead to property/land being permanently inaccessible as it is too dangerous to be near
- Contamination can quickly spread throughout an ecosystem, reaching crops and fish more than 200 miles away
- 733,000 curies of cesium entered the Pacific form Fukushima (Starr 2012), leading to contamination as far as California, with increased thyroid cancer rates in young children in many areas bordering the Pacific
- Most investors aren’t confident enough in nuclear energy’s profitability to invest, so most reactors rely on loans and tax dollar for funding
- ? Look into the Report of the Rasmussen group (Oct 1975), estimates of the worst possible reactor accident costing $60 billion USD in property damage
- Nuclear waste sites are also difficult to obtain (due to public resistance; it took 20 years for the Korean government to receive approval, see Jun et al. 2010)
- The author claims that the health/environmental risks associated with nuclear power greatly outweigh its meager economic potential

## section 5

- explores many possible energy generation methods, expansion of wind and development of artificial photosynthesis proposed

## meta notes

- The source appears and claims to be highly knowledgeable about the ins-and-outs of nuclear energy
- The source claims to strive to be unbiased, but seems to show preference against nuclear power (this is explicitly stated and addressed; claims that facts are inherently anti-nuclear)
- This was published in 2015, only 4 years after Fukushima (which is frequently mentioned/focused on)
- The source highly encourages readers to take the facts and come to their own conclusions (good superficially, but supplying readers with biased facts creates biased conclusions)
- Seems to advocate/promote development of artificial photosynthesis
- Decently respectable source list, some sources are repeated heavily

# “Elite Ideology and Risk Perception in Nuclear Energy Policy”

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1961958](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1961958)

- People are becoming more acutely aware of environmental risks (TMI?) and pollution, increasing media attention
- While before policy could be controlled by few elites (politicians, experts in the field), now there is much greater control
	- This can be a bad thing, as political activists/public interest groups hold more sway than the actual scientific experts ("The scientific establishment is far less influential than it once was;" (384) Cambridge Reports unpublished study)
- Policymaking is becoming stricter...
	- ...due to the greater impacts we as a society have (we have the capacity to injure larger populations)
	- ...due to our increased standards of living making us more risk-adverse (we expect better living, so we take steps to avoid risks)
	- ...due to scientific advancement publishing more accurate findings on trace substances concentrations (more easily detected) and effects
	- ...due to a cult involving the erosion of traditional American values????
- "\[B]usinessmen with financial and emotional commitments to new technologies find it very difficult to accept evidence of negative effects until such evidence becomes irrefutable" (384)
- 5 main claims/hypotheses of the article (385):
		**\1.** The relevant scientific community believes nuclear plants to be safe, and neither ideology nor economic self-interest plays a substantial role in their assessment.
		**\2.** Among other key leadership groups, by contrast, views about nuclear energy correlate with political ideology.
		**\3.** National media journalists are skeptical about nuclear safety.
		**\4.** Journalists inaccurately report the views of the relevant scientific community.
		**\5.** The views of other leadership groups on nuclear energy correlate highly with the news sources that they consider reliable.

## Nuclear Energy, Ideology, and the Perception of Risk

- Since the 1950s, U.S. support of nuclear energy has shifted from support to opposition (385)
- While economic factors influence some (political/business execs; plant abandonment and exceeding budget), most are worried about safety
- Table 1 is a survey of various figureheads on nuclear safety (386)
	- Overall 36.8% confidence in nuclear safety
	- Energy experts the most confidence (75.8%, 98.7% for nuclear)
		- It was determined that no economic self-interest/ideology majorly influences their position (387)
	- Public interest groups least (6.4%), next to TV/Movies/Hollywood and Media
	- ! Check out Institut fur Demoskopie 1985 for a similar study on German scientists
- "No matter how remote the possibility of their occurrence, \[nuclear] disasters are perceived as far more likely to b highly disruptive, both socially and psychologically" (387)
	- The paper later states that this is incorrect the same way that people don't worry about meteors striking (387)
	- The paper later (later) shows how the media does disproportionately focus on large disasters over everyday deaths (394)
- "The public can accept... that the number of deaths resulting from the burning of coal will be much greater than that... from the building of new nuclear plants because the former can be taken in stride" (387)
	- What? (see Perrow 1984) Coal deaths are simply overlooked because they've always happened?
- The paper proposes that ideology plays a large role in determining public perception of nuclear energy (Liberalism decreases; along with age, maleness, and being non-Jewish)
- While group membership (like being a Hollywood elite) seems to impact public perception, it may be inextricably linked to ideology in a way that cannot be properly isolated
	- However, being a Hollywood elite leads to reduced confidence while being in a military/bureaucrat group increases confidence
- These differences cannot be attributed to differences in risk perception (i.e. Liberals are not simply more risk-averse than conservatives)
	- Conservatives were more risk-averse during the 1950s fluoridation controversy and used similar arguments to anti-nuclear people today (? look into this ?)
- French communists are strong pro-nuclear? (390)
	- "The enemy of the workers is not nuclear power and science, but capitalists and management" (Golay 1980) (390)

## Nuclear Energy: Scientists versus the Media

- Although most scientists agree that nuclear energy is "a relatively benign energy source that should be tapped" (390), the public/elite think that scientists are split 50/50 (1984 national poll)
- "The scientific community as a whole does not communicate with the general public. Rather, a somewhat smaller group of more visible scientists does most of the communicating" (Goodell 1977) "...and this group seems skewed toward the antinuclear argument"(391)
- "The results suggest that antinuclear scientists reject traditional norms of scientific communication" (391; only making public statements on areas of expertise/only publicizing findings after they are accepted by professional journals)
- Antinuclear scientists publish more often in public/popular journals (compared to most/pronuclear scientists) than professional/academic ones (compared to...) (392)
- Antinuclear scientists also hold differing views on the safety/state of nuclear energy
- The antinuclear/popular group is very small (roughly 1.2k in AMWS)
- However, pronuclear scientists have published more in popular journals (overall) than antinuclear
- The paper explains this by saying that elite journalists are skeptical of nuclear energy (many are liberals) (392)
- National media seems to have developed an antinuclear tilt since 1970s, failing to properly report the views of the scientific community with more antinuclear sources/stories than pronuclear (393) (table 8)
	- The most quoted "independent expert" source is the antinuclear USC (Union of Concerned Scientists) (393)
	- "The only pronuclear sources in the top 10 \[top-quoted sources] were spokesmen for utility companies and the nuclear industry. As we have seen, the public credibility of such organization is quite low" (394)
- Bernard Cohen's poll finds that 91% of academics in the radiation health field find public fears of radiation exaggerated (and exaggerated in media) (394)
	- Some widely quoted experts in media (Dr. Sternglass following TMI) were ranked as untrustworthy
- "\[P]eople tend to trust 'experts' who share their own social outlooks" (394)
- "Today, however, journalists regard 'antiestablishment' scientists as rather more trustworthy than mainstream scientists" (Goodfield 1981) (394)
- There are differing views over how much influence the media has on public perception (recently people think its more)
	- It seems that those trust pronuclear sources are pronuclear, while those who trust public television are more antinuclear (395)

## The Perception of Risk as a Surrogate for Ideology

- This section tries to understand the subconscious motivations for holding certain attitudes
- It seems to suggest that the issue of nuclear energy is used as a focal point and surrogate to tackle the larger issue of attacking traditional U.S. institutions?
- Look into antinuclear activist Barry Commoner 1979 (Wolfe 1982, 243) (397)
- Left-leaning media seems to favor antinuclear views
- While many decisions regard nuclear power in France are made primarily by experts on the basis of technical information, U.S. activist movements have forced public participation in nuclear energy policy (397)
	- "It is clear that the irrationality of the regulatory process in the United States has been partly responsible for cost overruns and has, in some cases, probably reduced rather than enhanced the safety of nuclear energy" (398)
	- France is able to use similar technology as the U.S. while costing less to produce power with a better safety record (398)
	- However, France has a largely standardized nuclear industry, with almost-identical plant designs and thus a wealth of technical experience handling any mishaps (398)
	- In the U.S, plants are built by contracted firms that may not the same level of experience (many only build one plant), and reactor designs can vary much more along with requiring bureaucratic hearings/evaluations for approval (398)
- Antinuclear sentiments can be justified by the Atomic Energy Commission's purposeful concealment of certain nuclear dangers and overhype of nuclear power (cost and safety) (398)
## meta notes

  - Old (June 1987), close to TMI
  - Look into Ralph Nader; the article kinda hates on him (public figure)
  - The conclusion kind of lost me, felt motivated? (against the left/liberals?)
	  - Some large sections of it only draw from a few authors over and over
- Many of the conclusions are drawn from extensive statistics/properly gathered data
	- A lot of fun statistical analysis
- They describe their methodology, and little bias seems present


# “Decentralization of Control in U.S. Nuclear Energy Policy”

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2152291](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2152291)

- "\[A] credible source ranked the civilian U.S. nuclear power program as 'the largest managerial disaster in business history'" (James Cook qtd in 709)
- There are various theories for the failure of nuclear energy in the U.S:
	- The inflexibility of the technology itself (long lead times (construction/wind-up), high capital demands, large units)
	- The policy shift away from disaster containment to prevention spurred public scrutiny over the true safety of nuclear technology
	- Policymakers were initially over-enthusiastic about nuclear energy as a technology, rushing past important economic considerations
	- (This is the main one discussed) "\[T]he institutional fragmentation of the American polity and economy did not allow the comprehensive planning that would have been necessary for the success of the complex technology" (710)
		- See [[#The Perception of Risk as a Surrogate for Ideology]] to see France as an "antithesis" to the U.S.
- In the wake of disasters such as TMI, governments have slowly gained more influence on nuclear regulation
- "Decentralization of control obstructed the stable environment and the institutional homogeneity needed for the successful implementation of the nuclear program" (710)
- There are three main issues in the nuclear power debate:
	1. Emergency planning
	2. Utility rate regulation
	3. Waste disposal
- Activist groups against these issues only gained traction after much nuclear infrastructure was built, and its inflexible nature meant that little could be addressed
- The U.S. antinuclear movement has moved the industry toward decentralization, aided by president Carter as he appointed many movement leaders
	- Carter himself was opposed to commercial plutonium reprocessing and fast breeder reactors (see *Nuclear Power and Non-Proliferation* by Michael Brenner)
	- It's also important to note that Carter used to be a nuclear engineer, working on with the Navy's nuclear submarine program (outside knowledge)
- The nuclear industry was already suffering from construction costs, shrinking energy demand, and political difficulties, only to be mortally wounded after TMI due to decentralization (711)
	- As more regulatory control was handed to local governments, capped rates and waste regulations prevented any real chance of recovery
- "Yet nuclear power remained in a state of permanent siege. Alliances between local citizen groups and municipal, county, and state authorities in the fields of emergency planning, utility regulation, and nuclear waste policy wrecked newly completed nuclear plants, increased the financial crisis, and prevented the closing of the nuclear fuel cycle" (711)
- "\[T]he federal fragmentation of authority became both the central barrier to the economic and political recovery of American nuclear power and the nuclear opposition's major opportunity to compensate for the parallel decline of public interest in the energy issue in the 1980s" (711)
	- This argument supposedly contradicts theories of "interest-group liberalism" as described (i think) in [[#“Elite Ideology and Risk Perception in Nuclear Energy Policy”]]
	- "Especially during nuclear policy implementation at the local and state levels, the fragmented and decentralized American polity proved highly permeable to nonproducer groups" (712)
- "The fate of the nuclear industry is also a telling example of the power of American democratic institutions to thwart a project that had lost its societal legitimation" (712)

## The Impact of Three Mile Island

- "\[T]he accident at Three Mile Island... cast doubt on the long-standing convictions of the expert proponents, spread skepticism among public supporters, and redouble\[d] the efforts of opponents" (712)
- "The burden of proof, which up to then had rested with the nuclear critics, shifted to the promoters of nuclear power" (712)
	- No longer "why is nuclear bad," but now "why is nuclear good"
- Carter's appointed Kemeny Commission that investigated the cause of the accident supposedly had many outspoken nuclear critics (712)
- TMI was a "wake-up call" for the general public, which had overall trusted the expert risk analysis ("car driving and cigarette smoking are more dangerous than nuclear power" (712)) before
- TMI hit the nuclear industry in the midst of its growth, when economic and political issues were already troubling it, causing public support to plummet (713)
- After the disaster, NRC regulations became much stricter and essentially shut down the industry (no new reactors, more contingencies) (713)
- TMI also caused private investors of nuclear power to drop out, leading to major economic woes (713)
- However, with the decline of the nuclear industry came the decline of the antinuclear movement, sped up with the president Reagan's new nuclear rearmament policy and tensions with the USSR (pushing aside nuclear energy debate for nuclear *weapons* debate) (713)

## Citizen-State Alliances in the 1980s

- "The focus of conflict only shifted to the local and state levels, where the economic, technological, and sociopolitical infrastructure of already existing nuclear power plants offered multiple targets of attack" (714)
- "\[A]fter all, it was concrete communities, counties, and states that had to bear the costs of badly managed, carelessly constructed, or overly expensive nuclear power plants" (714)
	- Disconnect between policymakers designing nuclear infrastructure and common people bearing their mistakes
- Despite his administration's platform for free markets and federal deregulation, Reagan actively lifted regulations on nuclear and pushed for government support of nuclear (at the detriment of alternatives such as solar and nuclear) (714)
- However research into new nuclear technologies such as fast breeder reactors and fuel reprocessing was cancelled due to costs and technical challenges (714)
- As the governmental Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) and Congressional Joint Committee on Atomic Energy (JCAE) were dissolved in the 1970s, and state governments were allowed to prevent new reactor construction (11 by 1984 aided by a Supreme Court decision in 1983), local governments gained greater control in the more decentralized nuclear industry
- States would also pass "provincial laws" regulating the transportation and disposal of nuclear waste, which would indirectly lead to the phasing out of existing nuclear plants (716)

### Emergency Planning

- "The issue of evacuation and emergency planning is a telling example of previous policy negligence, which became visible so late that remedies had to be extremely costly" (716)
	- "The nuclear industry alone picked the reactor sites. As a result, most nuclear plants were built in the vicinity of major population centers, in order to minimize the costs of electricity transmission" (716)
		- Good for money, real bad for disaster
- Safety regulations following TMI forced reactors to have contingency plans for emergency evacuations, but this required the cooperation of local governments (to control traffic, medical, and emergency services) (716)
	- Local governments could effectively shut down a plant by refusing to cooperate (like the Indian Point, Shoreham, and Seabrook plants)
	- This was leveraged by the antinuclear movement, as bus drivers, volunteer firemen, and emergency workers could refuse to take part
		- $4 billion in plants would lay idle, costing more than $1 million for each day of nonoperation (716)
- However, the NRC never lastingly revoked operating licenses due to the lack of evacuation plans, and in 1988 the federal government was allowed to draft emergency plans if local governments refused (716)
### Utility Regulation

- The Arab oil embargo in 1973 led to skyrocketing electricity rates (overall), causing public protests to lower rates. Lower rates across the board meant that it would be harder to finance the construction of new nuclear plants (718)
- Many nuclear plants have cost overruns of 1000% over the initial budget or more, leading to skyrocketing electricity rates that infuriated consumers (719)
	- This leads to governments turning on the nuclear industry, no longer allowing for rate increases to fund plant construction (see the Shoreham plant)
- "Between 1982 and 1984 alone, thirty-two plants under construction were scrapped, some of them more than 50 percent completed, but their owners were without cash to proceed with construction" (719)
- "By 1988, about $30 billion had been wasted on nuclear plants abandoned before they were ready to operate; the costs for plants finished at excessive cost totalled \[sic] another $70 billion" (719)
- "Reactors coming on line \[sic] during the 1980s cost between $1,100 and $3,500 or more per kW in 1983 dollars, compared with the average of $600 per kW for the fifty-seven reactors completed before 1981" (720)
	- Note that safety regulations/policy also add costs (outside knowledge)

### Nuclear Waste Policy

- "Similar to emergency evacuation and utility regulation, the problem of waste disposal emerged at the back end of the nuclear policy cycle, consigning the costs of the technology's precarious infrastructure to concrete localities and states" (721)
- The nuclear industry's poor reputation following TMI lead to numerous campaigns against the development of nuclear waste disposal sites
- The Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act in 1980 forced the burden of disposing low-level waste (contaminated objects) on individual states and urging interstate negotiation
	- This led to "political warfare between states" as states with high amounts of waste were turned down by others
		- Thus some highly populated states with unaccommodating geography (California and New York) were forced to construct local dump sites (721)
- Waste sites are also subject to political gridlock, many of them resented by the public (721)
- "While most experts agree today that the disposal of high-level nuclear waste poses no unsolvable technical difficulties, its main impediment arises from concerns of political equality and societal acceptability" (722)
- "In a time when the clear majority of the public is opposed to nuclear power, no electorally accountable state government is willing to host a repository for the nation's high-level nuclear waste" (722)
- Due to being more of a long-term issue, research and development focused mainly on reactors themselves and not waste management (722)
- "In fact, each of the thirteen states at one point or another considered a possible choice \[for a national high-level waste dump] has mounted its decided resistance, from spontaneous citizen outrage to state-initiated legal intervention" (723)
- The first high-level waste site in Nevada was likely only constructed as Nevada held "the least political clout at the federal level" (723)

## Conclusion

- "\[T]he absence of positive leadership has allowed the technology to drift into an uneconomic mode, turning off the future growth of the industry" (Alvin Weinberg qtd. in 723)
- TMI induced social resistance to nuclear energy, leading to the decentralization of the nuclear industry as local governments gained more influence (724)
- "\[T]he institutional homogeneity required for the successful implementation of a highly inflexible and complex technology" was shattered as local governments gained control of the industry (724)
- "Not by accident, the nuclear enterprise succeeded only in political systems characterized by centralized control, most notably France, Japan, and South Korea, while it became embroiled in continuous controversy in federally fragmented political systems, such as the United States or West Germany" (724)
- Most of the conflicts of nuclear debate emerged after millions had be invested in nuclear energy and design/development had overlooked many important considerations

## meta notes

- Like the other sources, this one is old (1992-1993)
- This was published in a *political science* journal by a German sociologist
- The article is rife with citations/sources, but some major claims are uncited
- Initially it is hard to determine what the article was trying to get at/what the main argument was

# “Disgust Sensitivity and Public Opinion on Nuclear Energy”

**UNFINISHED**

[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272494421002024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272494421002024)
## 1. Introduction

- Many scientists agree that nuclear power is important in combatting climate change (2)
- However, there is public skepticism and opposition toward nuclear energy, highlighted by political protests (2)
- The article claims this disparity is the result of the "behavioral immune system," triggered by fears of contamination (2)

### 1.1 The Gap Between Experts and the Public on Nuclear Energy

- "Most experts on nuclear energy agree that nuclear power has no negative health consequences during normal operation, and that even the rare incidents have only caused a limited number of casualties" (3)
- "\[M]ost agree that nuclear power should be part of the solution to fight climate change" (3)
- Despite expert consensus, the public is divided/critical of nuclear
	- 53% of people worldwide (2005) thought that the risks outweighed the benefits (33% on the other side)
	- Only 20% of Europeans supported nuclear in their country (2015), with 37% opposing its use
	- Nuclear was once the least supported energy source, and is only supported by a minority now (3)
- Many claim that the media's portrayal of nuclear is a primary cause for public opposition (3)
	- Most media coverage is overall negative toward nuclear (3)
	- Over 70% of U.S. newspaper headlines painted nuclear in a bad light (3)
- However, this article claims that media does not play as strong a role
	- The public holds many misconceptions about nuclear that aren't present in media (produces CO2, depletes ozone) (4)
	- Even after the widely publicized Fukushima Daiichi accident, public support in the U.S. only dropped by a bit before returning to normal (4)
	- "Moreover, explanations that rely on biases in the media would still have to explain why the media is biased in the first place, especially since news media are strongly demand-driven, suggesting that bias in the media might be an effect rather than a cause of public opinion" (4)
		- ! This is an interesting point

### 1.2 The Behavioral Immune System and Disgust

- "In humans it has been suggested that a *behavioral immune system* evolved to supplement out physiological immune system by motivating people to avoid coming into contact with pathogens in the first place" (5)
	- It supposedly does this by triggering disgust toward potentially infected objects
- "\[P]eople might pay special attention to, want to learn more about, and share more information about potential pathogen threats" (5)
- "\[T]he behavioral immune system is expected to be hypervigilant and to err on the side of treating any pathogen cue as a potential threat" (5)
- People's sensitivity to potential threats can also vary, with some people having a stronger reaction to possible pathogens (5)
	- "\[P]eople with high disgust sensitivity have been shown to be more opposed to genetically modified food, and to support governmental regulation of food, air, and water" (6)

### 1.3 The Behavioral Immune System, Disgust, and Perceptions of Nuclear Energy

- "Neither radiation nor pathogens can be seen, but both can make people sick. Thus, radiation might also activate the behavioral immune system" (7)
	- However, there is a distinction in that radiation is dosage-dependent and not contagious
- "Yet much data suggests that people's understanding of nuclear radiation and its risks is guided by their intuitive understanding of contagion" (7)
	- "People who have been—or who are thought to have been—irradiated also tend to be treated by others as if they had been contaminated" (7)
- Since people appear to treat radiation like a infectious pathogen, it is very possible that radiation triggers their behavioral immune system (8)
