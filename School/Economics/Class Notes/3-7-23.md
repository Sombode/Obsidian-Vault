# Cost Analysis

## Types of Cost

### Accounting and Economic

*Accounting costs* (for accountants) only factor in *explicit costs* (outright monetary payments; tangible, concrete, objective).

*Economic costs* (for economists) also facor in *implicit costs* (the opportunity costs involved, what could've been gained from alternative ventures; intangible, abstract, subjective).

### Fixed and Variable

These are the two basic types of costs that a business will incur.

*Fixed costs* remain the same **regardless of output** (having a fixed cost indicates that the business is in the *short run*).
- **They do not determine production in the short run**
- They help determine operation in the long run
- Given enough time, it can become a variable cost
> ex. Property taxes, rent/mortage, tuition, insurance

*Variable costs* are based on production, increasing as production increases
- **They determine is a company continues to produce**
