# Consumer Surplus
Difference between the price you pay and the price you were willing to pay. Demand curves show how much people would be *willing* to pay, but lower prices than that amount leads to consumer surplus. Area of the triangle formed when a horizontal (set) price line bisects the demand curve. $$\frac{1}{2}b*h$$

# Supply
- Looking from the perspective of producers/businesses.
- How much of an item producers will provide at each price
- Direct relationship with price (law of supply)

## Factors Affecting Supply
- Change in number of suppliers (more suppliers provide more)
- Change in cost of production (higher costs means less production)
- Change in price of other goods (if farmers can profit more planting corn than wheat, they'll produce less wheat)
- Change in price expectations (if producers expect higher prices in the future, they stockpile and decrease current production. if prices are projected to fall, people sell more faster)
- Change in technology (more productivity, more production)
- Government policies (taxes shift left, subsidies shift right)
