# Short Run
- ATC and MC are determined by the *principle of diminishing marginal productivity/returns*
- Fixed and variable resources
	- Fixed: Capital, technology (cannot be changed in the short run)
	- Variable: Labor, materials (can be adjusted in the short run)

# Long Run
- A firm's *Long Run Average Total Cost (LRATC)* is the result of changing *economies of scale* (total cost lowers initially) and *diseconomies of scale* (total cost rises later on)
	- Like *diminishing returns* in the short run, but just called different things in the long run
- The long run allows for more change

## Economies of Scale
- Increased production lowers average costs
- **If a firm has higher fixed costs, economies of scale exist for a longer time period**
> Average cost will be lower even if total cost is higher. The capital investment needed increases total cost but makes average cost per unit lower by increasing efficiency/production rate.

## Diseconomies of Scale
- Increased production raises average costs
- **If a firm has smaller fixed costs, diseconomies of scale increase faster**

## Long Run Curves (LRATCs)
> SRATCs in a trench coat

- Essentially an interlinked series of ATC curves for different short-term levels of production
- Takes the minimum of all the ATC curves at a certain output (sometimes smoothed)

## Returns to Scale

As production increases, how does cost respond? (Kind of like elasticity)

- Increasing returns (economies of scale; ATC is downward sloping)
- Constant returns (ATC is flat at that point)
- Decreasing returns (diseconomies of scale; ATC is upward sloping)
