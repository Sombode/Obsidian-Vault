# Monopolies

Costs are the same as perfect competition:
- $MC=MR$ (produce here)
- $MC = ATC$ (productive efficiency)
- $P = MC$ (allocative efficiency)
- $MC = AVC$ (shutdown point)
- $ATC = AR$ (break-even point)

**One seller**, high barriers to entry, *price maker*, unique product, nonprice competition (PR).

AR (Demand) is no longer equal to MR (MR falls faster).

**Price is determined by from the value of the demand curve at optimal output.**
