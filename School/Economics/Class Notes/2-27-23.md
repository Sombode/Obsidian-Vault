# Excise Taxes

Taxes included with the price of the product, unlike sales tax (which is added afterward). Unknown portion will go to the government. 

Shifts supply to the left ("cost" increases, amount shifted is the excise tax) (eq price increases, eq quantity decreases).

Reduces both consumer and producer surplus by carving out the middle for the government (both must "pay" for the tax) (as eq quantity decreases, the "tip" of the surplus triangle is lost as [[#Deadweight Loss]]).

Government revenue is $Tax*Q$.

# Deadweight Loss

Optimal total surplus is compromised with the introduction of government involvement. 

When government taxes are imposed and equilibrium shifts away from the optimal point, the area of total surplus lost is the deadweight loss.
