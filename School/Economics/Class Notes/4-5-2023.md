# Monopolistic Competition

## Characteristics
- Large (ish) number
- Few barriers to entry (easy entry/exit)
- Product differentiation
	- Advertising (nonprice competition), brand loyalty
		- Adds to cost, tradeoff for increased demand
- Some price-setting power, but mostly a pricetaker
- No long-run profits (in theory)
	- Profit attracts firms (and entry is easy)
- NOT productively efficient nor allocatively efficient
	- *Excess capacity* is difference between productively efficient quantity (less profit) and production quantity
- Highly elastic demand

## Long Run
- Produces at $MC = MR$, which also is where $AR = ATC$ (normal profit/break even point).
