1/30/2023 Notes - Economics

# Economics

Study of choices in scarcity (how much we have, what we can do with it).
People can be erratic (generalizations must be made).

# Opportunity Cost

- Yes to one thing, no to another
- Choices require trade-offs (what you give up) 
- Costs include *implicit* (opportunity costs, time!) and *explicit* (price, in your face) costs
- Marginal benefits (incentives!), marginal costs

## Production Possibility Curves

- Shows the relationship between two decisions (possible combinations)
- Graphs!
- More of one means less of another
- Classic example: Guns (military spending) and Butter (domestic spending)

### Key Assumptions
- Simple model, two products
- Full utilization of resources
- Fixed resources (including time and technology)
- Resources are interchangeable

As long as you are on the curve, there is no *best* choice. It all depends on current preference/values. Points below the curve are also viable, but resources are under-utilized (inefficient, "waste of resources"). Production of any one good can be increased **without** loss of another, as unused resources can be used to produce. Points above/outside the curve are **unattainable**. 

Constant/straight or curved/bowed out.

*Side note: new techonology may only increase production for one good, not both.*

# Factors of Production
1. Land
	2. Natural resources (coal, fauna, flora, minerals, oil...)
2. (Real) Capital
	3. Man-made, tangible
	4. Machines, tools
	5. NOT MONEY
3. Labor (workers)
4. Entreprenuers
	5. Visionaries, risk-bearers (for profit!)
	6. Put everything together to make/do something

Human capital (education, skills, abilities; sometimes part of it, sometimes not)

# Marginal Thinking

Benefit vs. cost, lost of potential gain.
