# Demand
- The market from the perspective of consumers (the [[Product Market]])
- How much of an item consumers want to buy at a price
- **Inversely related to price**

## Demand Schedules
A table listing/relating price and quantity demanded (under [[Basic Economic Concepts#Ceteris Paribus]]). This shows a *change in quantity demanded*, not a *change in demand*.

## Demand Curves
A graphical representation of the relationship described by [[#Demand Schedules]]. **Price is always the IV, on the y-axis**.

## Law of Demand
As price increases, demand decreases. $Inc \$ = Dec Q_D$
As price decreases, demand increases. $Dec \$ = Inc Q_D$

Price and demand have an inverse relationship.

## Income Effect
- Decreasing prices creates an income effect
- With low prices, people feel like they can buy more ("more money in your pocket") (the opposite is also true)
- Works independent of actual paycheck/income

## Substitution Effect
- The lower price of an item, the more people use it (the opposite is also true)
- When something is cheap, people find more uses for it

## Diminishing Marginal Utility
- With more units, you get less satisfaction with additional units
- Consumables (food, clothes)
> ex. Eating the first banana doesn't give the same satisfaction as the 100th banana

## Factors Affecting Demand
- Demand schedules show change in quantity demanded when price changes, but other factors exist (which fundamentally change the demand schedule/curve):
	- Change in number of consumers (more people buy more stuff)
	- Change in income (less money means people buy less stuff)
	- Change in price of other goods
		- Complementary goods (go together, i.e. chips and dip; as one price increases demand for the other might decrease)
		- Substitutes (alternatives, competition, i.e. milk and oat milk; lower prices for one drive down demand for the other)
	- Change in consumers' expectations
		- Hoarding! (toilet paper!)
		- If people think something will run out soon, people will flock to buy it (panic buying)
		- If people expect the price to drop later, they won't buy it now (drop in current demand)
	- Change in consumers attitudes (preferences; trends/fads)
