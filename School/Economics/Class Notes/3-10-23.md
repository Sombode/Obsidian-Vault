# Competition

Depends on:
- Number of firms
- Ease of entering the market (more firms means easier)
- Type of product
- Price-setting power
- Long-term (economic) profits
- Advertising (*non-price competition*)

## Types 

### Perfect (Pure) Competition

- Many firms (easy entry)
- Homogenous product (same/similar stuff, *generic*)
- No advertising
- No price-setting power (sellers are *pricetakers*)
- Few long-run profits
- **Allocatively and productively efficient** ($P=MC$ and $P=MC=ATC$)
	- Only type that is
	- Resources best used for society
	- Producing at the lowest average price (no price-setting power)
> ex. Produce/agriculture (brand of onion doesn't really matter) and other *commodities* (oil, water, salt, gold, corn...)

### Monopolisitic Competition

- Many firms (easy to enter)
- Differentiated product
- Advertising (brand loyalty)
- Some price-setting power (depends on brand loyalty)
- No long-run profits (no barriers)
> ex. Fast food

### Oligopolies

- A few firms (hard to enter)
- Could be either homogenous or differentiated product (cell phone service, aluminum; coke, pepsi)
- Big advertising (if differentiated)
- Little price-setting power 
	- *Mutual interdependence* (constant undercutting means no gains from lowering price, thus same/similar prices)
	- *Price leadership* (competition tests the water with a change, and others will follow)
	- Companies compete on brand loyalty/advertising, not prices
- High profits (barriers to entry)
> ex. Cereal, soda, cars, cigarettes, cable

### Monopolies

- One firm (very hard to enter)
- *Unique* product
- Little advertising, but have *public relations* (feel good about having no choice)
- High price-setting power
- High profits (barriers to entry)
> ex. Patents (protected IPs), utilities (water, waste management...), Disney!
