# Chapter 1
> Limits, Alternatives, and Choices

## Scarcity
> [[Basic Economic Concepts#Scarcity|Related Section]]

Society's wants/needs far exceed what it has available, with goods and services in limited supply (called the **Economizing Problem**). Scarcity causes choices, because you "can't have it all." Even if something is "free" to you, someone else bears the cost.

## Utility

**Utility is the measure of satisfaction of a good/service, or the benefit derived from it.** Humans follow "rational self-interest," carefully choosing opportunities to increase utility. Faulty logic or skewed values can affect what people see as "rational," and emotions can be a key factor. This doesn't mean people are inherently selfish, as increasing utility can come from helping others (pleasure from charity work, raising children, etc.).

## Marginal Thinking

Marginal thinking/marginal analysis revolves around thinking of **what comes next**. People consider **changes** in the current system (ex. Should I study an hour more? Should the government increase funding?) by looking at the marginal benefits and marginal costs to make rational choices. 

> ex. If you choose to buy a larger diamond, the *marginal cost* is the extra money it will cost, but the *marginal benefit* is the longer pleasure derived from it.

Marginal costs can include [[Basic Economic Concepts#Opportunity Cost|opportunity costs]].

## Scientific Thinking

Economists can rely on the [[Scientific Method]] to rationally produce economic laws/principles, widely accepted/tested general assumptions on economic behaviors. They also simplify the world to better understand it, seen with [[Basic Economic Concepts#Ceteris Paribus|Ceteris Paribus]].

## Types of Economics

### Micro/Macro
> [[Basic Economic Concepts#Microeconomics|Related Section]]

Microeconomics works on the individual scale, focusing on singular/specific objects (products, consumers).

Macroeconomics works on a larger scope, frequently using *aggregates* to represent components of a system (lumping together all people as *consumers*)

### Positive and Normative
> [[Basic Economic Concepts#Positive Economics|Related Section]]

Positive economics works with pure facts and cause-and-effect relationships. 

Normative economics incorporates *value judgements* about recommended actions/*what it ought to be* (more subjunctive).
