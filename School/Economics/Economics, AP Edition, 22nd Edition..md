# Chapter 1
> Limits, Alternatives, and Choices

## Scarcity
> [[Basic Economic Concepts#Scarcity|Related Section]]

Society's wants/needs far exceed what it has available, with goods and services in limited supply (called [[#The Economizing Problem]]). Scarcity causes choices, because you "can't have it all." Even if something is "free" to you, someone else bears the cost.

## Utility

**Utility is the measure of satisfaction of a good/service, or the benefit derived from it.** Humans follow "rational self-interest," carefully choosing opportunities to increase utility. Faulty logic or skewed values can affect what people see as "rational," and emotions can be a key factor. This doesn't mean people are inherently selfish, as increasing utility can come from helping others (pleasure from charity work, raising children, etc.).

## Marginal Thinking

Marginal thinking/marginal analysis revolves around thinking of **what comes next**. People consider **changes** in the current system (ex. Should I study an hour more? Should the government increase funding?) by looking at the marginal benefits (MB) and marginal costs (MC) to make rational choices. 

> ex. If you choose to buy a larger diamond, the *marginal cost* is the extra money it will cost, but the *marginal benefit* is the longer pleasure derived from it.

Marginal costs can include [[Basic Economic Concepts#Opportunity Cost|opportunity costs]].

Optimized choices often occur when $MB=MC$

## Scientific Thinking

Economists can rely on the [[Scientific Method]] to rationally produce economic laws/principles, widely accepted/tested general assumptions on economic behaviors. They also simplify the world to better understand it, seen with [[Basic Economic Concepts#Ceteris Paribus|Ceteris Paribus]].

## Types of Economics

### Micro/Macro
> [[Basic Economic Concepts#Microeconomics|Related Section]]

Microeconomics works on the individual scale, focusing on singular/specific objects (products, consumers).

Macroeconomics works on a larger scope, frequently using *aggregates* to represent components of a system (lumping together all people as *consumers*)

### Positive and Normative
> [[Basic Economic Concepts#Positive Economics|Related Section]]

Positive economics works with pure facts and cause-and-effect relationships. 

Normative economics incorporates *value judgements* about recommended actions/*what it ought to be* (more subjunctive).

## The Economizing Problem

People's desires for good/services (be it necessities or luxuries) far exceed their ability to procure them. These unlimited desires are restricted by limited resources, and can be near impossible to truly satiate.

### Budget Lines

Budget lines/constraints can be used to visualize the combinations of two products a consumer can buy with a set budget. *Similar to a [[Basic Economic Concepts#Production Possibility Curves||PPC]] where the resource used is money.* 

![[Sample Budget Line.png]]

### Society

Society itself faces an economizing problem, as it has limited resources to allocate and use. These *economic resources* fall under four main categories:
1. Land
	1. Natural resources (forests, oil deposits, water, wind, sunlight, etc.)
2. Labor
	1. Physical action and mental activities of people
3. (Real) Capital
	1. *Captial goods* are the manufactured aids to help in producing consumer goods/services (factories, transport, storage, tools, etc.) 
	2. Spending on this is generally called an *investment*
	3. Money is **NOT** an economic resource
4. Entrepreneurial Ability
	1. A human resource distinct from labor, where *entrepreneurs*:
		1. Take initiative to start producing a good/service
		2. Make strategic business decisions for an enterprise
		3. Innovate, making new products/techniques
		4. Bear risk to bring forth new products/ideas
5. Human Capital
	1. The skills/abilities of people
	2. Commonly education
	3. Sometimes not listed as a economic resource

These resources are called *factors of production*, or *inputs*.

Choosing to produce consumer goods (that immediately satisfy wants) over capital goods help satisfy current wants, but hinders future production capability. Capital goods can help build delayed gratification down the road, leading to greater economic growth in the future.

> The Market System and Circular Flow

## Economic Systems

Economic systems are designed to solve a society's [[#The Economizing Problem|Economizing Problem]], differing in (1) who owns factors of production and (2) the method used to motivate, coordinate, and direct economic activity.

The two extreme ends of economic systems are the decentralized *laissez-faire capitalism* ("pure capitalism," minimal government influence, the market directs activity) and the highly centralized *command system* (heavy government influence/control; seen in communist/socialist countries such as the USSR, Cuba, and China; government owns/controls business firms, centralized planning). Most economic systems lie in-between, called *market systems*/*mixed economies* (capitalism, a mix of government initiatives and decentralized actions, buyers and sellers come together at *markets* to conduct activity, many can and will act in self-interest).

## The Market System

Market systems are a mix of command and laissez-faire systems, with a mix of self-interest and government initiatives.

Market systems work to answer 5 main questions:
1. [[#What goods and services will be produced?]]
2. [[#How will the goods and services be produced?]]
3. [[#Who will get the output?]]
4. [[#How will the system accommodate change?]]
5. [[#How will the system promote progress?]]

> Yes, some of these are similar to the fundamental [[Basic Economic Concepts#^def918|economic questions]] for all societies.

### What Goods and Services will be Produced?

Products that produce a net profit will be produced, while those that produce a net loss will be discontinued. In terms of total revenue (TR) and total cost (TC), industries where $TR>TC$ will stay and possibly grow. Industries where $TR<TC$ will shrink and some may go out of business.

Most choices revolve around individual businesses joining or leaving industries, and **businesses are driven by the choices/preferences of consumers** (*consumer sovereignty*). What consumers buy with their "*dollar votes*" indicate what they do/do not want to buy, influencing the market.
### How Will the Goods and Services be Produced?

The manufacturing/production process for goods/services will be optimized to minimize cost in order to maximize profit, with many factors playing into optimized costs (labor, resources, location).

>Cost optimization becomes more important as competition comes into play, with multiple sellers competing to lower costs and sell to consumers with the cheapest prices possible.
### Who will get the Output?

As long as one can and is willing to pay the price of a product, they generally are able to obtain it. This can be influenced by one's income and preferences.
### How will the System accommodate Change?

Market systems are dynamic, constantly adjusting and changing as self-interest dictates the people will look to optimize costs and profits. As resource costs change (change in price of labor, new technology or production processes), so will the the method of production. As consumers spend more money on one industry over another, that industry will get more revenue to expand an

### How will the System promote Progress?

> International Trade

## Why Trade?

1. The distribution of resources among nations is uneven
2. Efficient production requires specialized/expertise with technology
3. Products differ in quality/attributes, so imported goods may be preferred over domestic

> ex. China can mass produce *labor-intensive goods* (for... reasons) like textiles and electronics, Australia can produce *land-intensive goods* such as wool and meat, Mexico has the climate to mass produce produce, and the US can produce *capital-intensive goods* such as vehicles, equipment, and machinery due to its industrialization. With this, each country can specialize in certain products they excel at producing and get the others from each other.

Trade also deters monopolies by promoting competition, with foreign firms competing with domestic, each innovating to find the lowest prices. Trade plays a large role in preventing war, and imported products allow for a wider variety of goods.

## Comparative/Absolute Advantage

*Open economies* (to international trade) produce more of some goods (*exports*) than others (*imports*) than they would if they were a *closed economy*. This is because with trade, becoming increasingly specialized in producing certain goods means that the nation has an *absolute advantage* (as it is a more efficient producer of that good than others, being specialized; **lower per unit cost**) and *comparative advantage* (if it can produce the product at a **lower [[Basic Economic Concepts#Opportunity Cost|Opportunity Cost]]** than others).

With a constant [[Basic Economic Concepts#Production Possibility Curves|PPC]] in mind, the comparative advantage of a country depends on its *opportunity-cost ratio* (*domestic exchange ratio*) of the two goods compared to others. 

The exchange rate between the goods when traded between countries is called the *terms of trade* (*international exchange ratio*). Each party involved wants (but isn't always able to) to get a ratio that is **better** than if they produced it themselves.

### Trading Possibility Lines

A modified domestic [[Basic Economic Concepts#Production Possibility Curves|PPC]] illustrating what an economy could get if it specialized in one resource and traded for the other, generally allowing for greater amounts of one resource it couldn't previously reach.

![[Sample TPL.png]]

### Principle of Comparative Advantage
**It is best to specialize in producing goods where you have lower opportunity costs than others.

Some argue that *absolute advantage* is not as necessary as *comparative advantage*, so even countries more productive than others should trade. Even having *absolute disadvantage* still doesn't matter as long as *comparative advantage* exists (better to delegate resource cost to others).

Specialization results in better/efficient resource allocation, and increases the possible amount of resources for all parties involved. The extra resources that can be gained under this (compared to if it were self-sufficient) are called *gains from trade*.

### Trade with Increasing Opportunity Costs

If opportunity costs were to increase with each unit of one good, as it [[Basic Economic Concepts#Law of Increasing Opportunity Cost|usually does]], trade becomes less optimal as each party tries to optimize its production ratio, and the differing ratios that provide trade with its benefits disappear. This leads to less-than-complete specialization, and sometimes domestic products can compete with imported ones.
