# Chapter 1
> Limits, Alternatives, and Choices

## Scarcity
> [[Basic Economic Concepts#Scarcity|Related Section]]

Society's wants/needs far exceed what it has available, with goods and services in limited supply. Scarcity causes choices, because you "can't have it all." Even if something is "free" to you, someone else bears the cost.

## Utility

**Utility is the measure of satisfaction of a good/service, or the benefit derived from it.** Humans follow "rational self-interest," carefully choosing opportunities to increase utility. Faulty logic or skewed values can affect what people see as "rational," and emotions can be a key factor. This doesn't mean people are inherently selfish, as increasing utility can come from helping others (pleasure from charity work, raising children, etc.).

## Marginal Thinking

Marginal thinking/marginal analysis revolves around thinking of **what comes next**. People consider **changes** in the current system (ex. Should I study an hour more? Should the government increase funding?) by looking at the marginal benefits and marginal costs to make rational choices. 

> ex. If you choose to buy a larger diamond, the *marginal cost* is the extra money it will cost, but the *marginal benefit* is the longer pleasure derived from it.

Marginal costs can include [[Basic Economic Concepts#Opportunity Cost|opportunity costs]].

## Scientific Thinking

Economists can rely on the [[Scientific Method]] to rationally produce economic laws/principles, widely accepted/tested general assumptions on economic behaviors. They also simplify the world to better understand it, seen with [[Basic Economic Concepts#Ceteris Paribus|Ceteris Paribus]].
