# Chapter 1
> Limits, Alternatives, and Choices

## Scarcity
> [[Basic Economic Concepts#Scarcity|Related Section]]

Society's wants/needs far exceed what it has available, with goods and services in limited supply (called [[#The Economizing Problem]]). Scarcity causes choices, because you "can't have it all." Even if something is "free" to you, someone else bears the cost.

## Utility

**Utility is the measure of satisfaction of a good/service, or the benefit derived from it.** Humans follow "rational self-interest," carefully choosing opportunities to increase utility. 

Utility is highly subjective. Faulty logic or skewed values can affect what people see as "rational," and emotions can be a key factor. This doesn't mean people are inherently selfish, as increasing utility can come from helping others (pleasure from charity work, raising children, etc.).

Utility is commonly measured in "utils."

## Marginal Thinking

Marginal thinking/marginal analysis revolves around thinking of **what comes next**. People consider **changes** in the current system (ex. Should I study an hour more? Should the government increase funding?) by looking at the marginal benefits (MB) and marginal costs (MC) to make rational choices. 

> ex. If you choose to buy a larger diamond, the *marginal cost* is the extra money it will cost, but the *marginal benefit* is the longer pleasure derived from it.

Marginal costs can include [[Basic Economic Concepts#Opportunity Cost|opportunity costs]].

Optimized choices often occur when $MB=MC$

![[Sample MB = MC.png]]

## Scientific Thinking

Economists can rely on the [[Scientific Method]] to rationally produce economic laws/principles, widely accepted/tested general assumptions on economic behaviors. They also simplify the world to better understand it, seen with [[Basic Economic Concepts#Ceteris Paribus|Ceteris Paribus]].

## Types of Economics

### Micro/Macro
> [[Basic Economic Concepts#Microeconomics|Related Section]]

Microeconomics works on the individual scale, focusing on singular/specific objects (products, consumers).

Macroeconomics works on a larger scope, frequently using *aggregates* to represent components of a system (lumping together all people as *consumers*)

### Positive and Normative
> [[Basic Economic Concepts#Positive Economics|Related Section]]

Positive economics works with pure facts and cause-and-effect relationships. 

Normative economics incorporates *value judgements* about recommended actions/*what it ought to be* (more subjunctive).

## The Economizing Problem

People's desires for good/services (be it necessities or luxuries) far exceed their ability to procure them. These unlimited desires are restricted by limited resources, and can be near impossible to truly satiate.

### Budget Lines

Budget lines/constraints can be used to visualize the combinations of two products a consumer can buy with a set budget. *Similar to a [[Basic Economic Concepts#Production Possibility Curves||PPC]] where the resource used is money.* 

![[Sample Budget Line.png]]

### Factors of Production

Society itself faces an economizing problem, as it has limited resources to allocate and use. These *economic resources* fall under four main categories:
1. Land
	1. Natural resources (forests, oil deposits, water, wind, sunlight, etc.)
2. Labor
	1. Physical action and mental activities of people
3. (Real) Capital
	1. *Captial goods* are the manufactured aids to help in producing consumer goods/services (factories, transport, storage, tools, etc.) 
	2. Spending on this is generally called an *investment*
	3. Money is **NOT** an economic resource
4. Entrepreneurial Ability
	1. A human resource distinct from labor, where *entrepreneurs*:
		1. Take initiative to start producing a good/service
		2. Make strategic business decisions for an enterprise
		3. Innovate, making new products/techniques
		4. Bear risk to bring forth new products/ideas
5. Human Capital
	1. The skills/abilities of people
	2. Commonly education
	3. Sometimes not listed as a economic resource

These resources are called *factors of production*, or *inputs*.

Choosing to produce consumer goods (that immediately satisfy wants) over capital goods help satisfy current wants, but hinders future production capability. Capital goods can help build delayed gratification down the road, leading to greater economic growth in the future.

# Chapter 2
> The Market System and Circular Flow

## Economic Systems

Economic systems are designed to solve a society's [[#The Economizing Problem|Economizing Problem]], differing in (1) who owns factors of production and (2) the method used to motivate, coordinate, and direct economic activity.

The two extreme ends of economic systems are the decentralized *laissez-faire capitalism* ("pure capitalism," minimal government influence, the market directs activity) and the highly centralized *command system* (heavy government influence/control; seen in communist/socialist countries such as the USSR, Cuba, and China; government owns/controls business firms, centralized planning). Most economic systems lie in-between, called *market systems*/*mixed economies* (capitalism, a mix of government initiatives and decentralized actions, buyers and sellers come together at *markets* to conduct activity, many can and will act in self-interest).

## The Market System

Market systems are a mix of command and laissez-faire systems, with a mix of self-interest and government initiatives.

The three main virtues of the market system are:
1. **Efficiency** in promoting better/cheaper production methods
2. **Incentives** for innovation and work in economic rewards
3. **Freedom** for workers and businesses to work in self-interest, and be rewarded/punished

### Characteristics of the Market System

Private individual/businesses are able to own *private property* (land, capital) and enter legally binding contracts.

Enforced property rights protect people from having property stolen, and so exchanges must be *mutually agreeable*.

> ex. Copyright law, protection from government seizure (Amendment IV????)

*Freedom of enterprise* allows businesses to obtain/use resources to produce and sell their chosen products in their chosen markets, and *freedom of choice* allows businesses to employ/dispose of resources and money as they see fit, and consumers can buy products they desire.

Businesses are driven by *self-interest*, and the interests of consumers are understood through *markets*.

Businesses and firms generally *specialize* in producing one/a few goods/services.
> Human specialization exists in the *division of labor*, allowing people to use their skillset to the fullest potential, saving time and resources.

The government does act, but in a limited way.

### Money

Money does not provide anything, but is used as a *medium of exchange*, simplifying trade. Instead of *bartering* one good for another, money can be exchanged to allow for parties to buy other things in exchange. As long as sellers accept the money, it can be used to facilitate trade.


### Downfalls of Command Systems

#### Coordination

With a few needing to coordinate the many, it becomes more difficult to effectively coordinate and execute tasks. If one resource is underperforms, everything that relies on it underperforms as well. This later resulted in cutting down product variety to make up for the complexity of coordination.

#### Measurement

With profit as the general measure of success in market/laissez-faire systems, command economies lack the means to effectively measure the performance of the economy. They used production quotas, but this sacrificed quality and variety for number. If a designated weight was to be the quota, companies would produce large and heavy objects in few quantities. If a designated amount was set, then companies produced many small objects.
#### Incentive

Planners needed to account for public needs and accordingly accommodate, but this seldom worked well. Shortage and surplus was common. Factory managers never had incentive to adjust as they were rewarded as long as they met the set quota.

### Essential Questions to Market Systems

Market systems work to answer 5 main questions:
1. [[#What goods and services will be produced?]]
2. [[#How will the goods and services be produced?]]
3. [[#Who will get the output?]]
4. [[#How will the system accommodate change?]]
5. [[#How will the system promote progress?]]

> Yes, some of these are similar to the fundamental [[Basic Economic Concepts#^def918|economic questions]] for all societies.

#### What Goods and Services will be Produced?

Products that produce a net profit will be produced, while those that produce a net loss will be discontinued. In terms of total revenue (TR) and total cost (TC), industries where $TR>TC$ will stay and possibly grow. Industries where $TR<TC$ will shrink and some may go out of business.

Most choices revolve around individual businesses joining or leaving industries, and **businesses are driven by the choices/preferences of consumers** (*consumer sovereignty*). What consumers buy with their "*dollar votes*" indicate what they do/do not want to buy, influencing the market.
#### How Will the Goods and Services be Produced?

The manufacturing/production process for goods/services will be optimized to minimize cost in order to maximize profit, with many factors playing into optimized costs (labor, resources, location).

>Cost optimization becomes more important as competition comes into play, with multiple sellers competing to lower costs and sell to consumers with the cheapest prices possible.
#### Who will get the Output?

As long as one can and is willing to pay the price of a product, they generally are able to obtain it. This can be influenced by one's income and preferences.
#### How will the System accommodate Change?

Market systems are dynamic, constantly adjusting and changing as self-interest dictates the people will look to optimize costs and profits. As resource costs change (change in price of labor, new technology or production processes), so will the the method of production. As consumers spend more money on one industry over another, that industry will get more revenue to expand and grow, while the other will shrink (once again *consumer sovereignty*).

#### How will the System promote Progress?

##### Technological Advancement

Competition in industries constantly drives businesses to find ways to undercut others with lower prices, adding incentive to find cheaper ways to produce/distribute products and innovate in production processes.

Businesses must keep with the development of new innovations/products as they supplant old ones (called *creative destruction*).
> ex. Vinyl records were replaced by CDs, CDs were replaced with online streaming. 

##### Captial Accumulation

Consumer preferences (*dollar votes*) for certain products give businesses the revenue to buy capital goods to increase and expand production, allowing for greater profits in the future.

## The Invisible Hand

A key concept of laissez-faire and market systems, the "invisible hand" as described by [[Adam Smith]] guides businesses to promote the public interest.

Competition drives businesses to create better products for less (see [[#Technological Advancement|here]] and [[#How will the System accommodate Change?|here]]), and so tailor towards the interest of consumers. In following their self-interest for profit, they must accommodate others' interests for products. Cheaper/more efficient production methods free up resources for other applications as well.

## Circular Flow

A dynamic market economy can be represented with a *circular flow model*, showing the continuous flow of resources ([[#Factors of Production]]) and products in an economy (in this case without a government). *Households* sell *resources* (land, labor...) to businesses in the *resource market* in exchange for a *salary*/*income*. *Businesses* then use the resources to produce *goods/services*, which they sell back to households in the *product market*.

![[Circular Flow Model.png]]

Households represent the individuals, providing all of the [[#Factors of Production]] and receiving all of the income in the economy.

Households are compensated for selling their [[#Factors of Production]] with the following (same thing, just different names):
- *Income* for labor
- *Rent* for land
- *Interest* for capital
- *Profit* for entrepreneurial ability

Businesses are commercial establishments meant to earn profit for owners, and fall into three main categories:
1. **Sole proprietorships** owned and managed by one person
2. **Partnerships** of 2+ people pooling resources/skills to own and operate a business
3. **Corporations** that are an independent legal entity, able to engage in activity by itself
	1. As not *owned* by anyone, supporters/owners do not bear any personal responsibility to its finances; most corporations are supervised by a board of directors

## Risk

Production of goods/services can be risky with shortages, change in public preferences, and natural disasters crippling supply chains.

Entrepreneurs bear the risk and are either rewarded with profit or punished with loss under the *profit system*, incentivizing them to make better decisions.

> Employees and suppliers (of loans or resources) are shielded from this risk, as they are legally entitled to **payment regardless of losses** (this also helps to attract employees/suppliers, as they get a guaranteed salary). However, this also means **they do not share any profit made**. Owners get the remaining money after they are paid, and as such they are known as *residual claimants*.


# Chapter 3
> Demand, Supply, and Market Equilibrium

## Markets

Markets are the places where independent buyers and sellers come together to exchange/trade goods and services. This can be interpreted in physical goods (food, resources), or other [[#Factors of Production]], like labor. The interaction between buyers and sellers is what drives pricing.

## Demand

From a consumer's perspective (in the [[#Circular Flow|product market]]), demand is how much of a product consumers are **willing and able** to buy at certain prices, under [[Basic Economic Concepts#Ceteris Paribus|Ceteris Paribus]]. A *demand schedule* is a table showing the relation between price and quantity demanded (usually $P$ and $D$ or $Q_D$, where price is **always** the IV but on the y-axis). *Demand curves* are graphical representations of demand schedules.

Quantity demanded is meaningless without the context of a time period, allowing how much demand there is to be determined.
> ex. Buying ten bushels of corn vs. buying ten bushels of corn per week

It is important to note that it is **quantity** demanded, not demand.

In terms of [[#Equilibrium]], an increase in demand increases the equilibrium quantity and equilibrium price.

![[Sample Demand Curve.png]]
### Law of Demand

As price falls, the quantity demanded rises (and the inverse). This is an **inverse relationship** between price and quantity demanded.$$\downarrow P \Longrightarrow \uparrow Q_D$$$$ \uparrow P \Longrightarrow \downarrow Q_D$$
#### Income Effect

The cheaper something is, the more money is left in the consumer's wallet,  making them feel like they can buy more (and they can; it increases their money's *purchasing power*). If the price of something goes down, it may feel like people are getting larger paychecks, even if their income hasn't changed. The inverse is also true.

#### Substitution Effect

People will look to substitute cheaper products in place of more expensive ones, trying to get a better deal. If a product is cheap, people will try to find more uses for it or use it more. The inverse is also true.

#### Diminishing Marginal Utility

The more of something you consume, the less [[#Utility]] each additional unit gives. This applies to most consumables (food, clothes, etc.). *Spice of life*. As this occurs, consumers will only buy more units of a product if the price is reduced with the utility.
> ex. Eating the 100th banana doesn't have the same enjoyment as the 1st banana.

### Individual and Market

While individual demand is easier to calculate, the market demand is just the aggregate sum of individual demands in a market.

### Determinants of Demand

While price is the main driver of demand, other *determinants of demand* (also *demand shifters*) exist:
- **Change in number of consumers** (more people buy more stuff)
- **Change in income** (less money means people buy less stuff)
	- Products with prices **directly** related to income (which most items have) are called *superior goods*/*normal goods*
	- Products with prices **inversely** related to income (such as lower quality/used products) are called *inferior goods*
- **Change in price of other goods**
	- *Complementary goods* (go together, i.e. chips and dip; as one price increases demand for the other might decrease)
	- *Substitutes* (alternatives, competition, i.e. milk and oat milk; lower prices for one drive down demand for the other)
	- Goods with no bearing on goods are *independent goods*
- **Change in consumers' expectations**
	- If people think something will run out soon, people will flock to buy it (panic buying)
	- If people expect the price to drop later, they won't buy it now (drop in current demand)
- **Change in consumers attitudes** (taste; preferences; trends/fads)

All of these can also work in reverse.

Note that these cause a **change in demand** itself, not just a change in quantity demanded. Rather than moving a point along the demand curve, the demand curve itself is shifted. 

## Supply

Very similar to [[#Demand]], but showing the amount of product that producers are **willing and able** to make available for sale at various prices over a specific period ($S$ or $Q_S$ for supply). *Supply schedules*, *supply curves*, *quantity supplied vs supply*, *market and individual supply* work similarly.

In terms of [[#Equilibrium]], an increase in supply increases the equilibrium quantity and decreases equilibrium price.

![[Sample Supply Curve.png]]

### Law of Supply
As price rises, the quantity supplied rises (and the inverse). This is an **direct relationship** between price and quantity supplied.$$\uparrow P \Longrightarrow \uparrow Q_S$$$$ \downarrow P \Longrightarrow \downarrow Q_S$$
While price is the restricting barrier on consumers buying a product, it is the reward/*revenue* of the producer. Greater revenue incentivizes greater production.

### Determinants of Supply

*Change in supply* can occur based on the following factors:
- **Change in number of sellers** (more sellers increase market supply)
- **Change in resource prices** (higher costs of production decrease profits and incentives, increasing price)
- **Change in technology** (better technology and techniques of production increase efficiency, lowering production cost and increasing supply)
- **Change in taxes and subsidies
	- Government taxes increase production costs, decrease supply
	- Government subsidies effectively lowers production costs, increases supply
- **Change in price of other goods** (sellers may switch production to higher value goods, if possible, called a *substitution in production*)
- **Change in producer expectations** (if sellers expect future prices to be high, they may either lower current supply and stockpile or increase production and increase current supply) 

## Equilibrium

The *equilibrium price* (also *market-clearing price*) in a competitive market is the price where the intentions of buyers and sellers match, where quantity demanded matches quantity supplied (at the *equilibrium quantity*). $$Q_D=Q_S$$  If neither shortage nor surplus exists, then the market is in equilibrium. Surplus will drive down prices, and shortage will drive up price. Equilibrium is naturally achieved in a market by individual decisions, known as the *rationing function of prices*, where those able and willing to provide for the equilibrium price are able to do so, and those who can't won't.

## Efficiency

Competitive markets also allow for more efficient allocation of a society's resources toward a product.

### Productive Efficiency

The price per production of one unit is decreased through the right mix of resource allocation and technology, resulting in the production of a good in the least costly way, which is *production efficiency*. This leaves extra resources for other uses.

### Allocative Efficiency

A society naturally allocates more resources to more desirable products and less resources to less desirable products. This results in the particular mix of products produced that maximizes [[#Utility]] produced with resources, using resources in the most desirable ways to achieve the most efficient assignments.

## Government Action

### Price Ceilings

Hard limits on prices designed to aid poorer consumers, *price ceilings* (or *ceiling prices*) often cap the legal price for essential goods. To have any effect, the ceiling must be **below** the equilibrium price.
> ex. Rent and interest caps

The problem with this is that at a lower price, more is demanded than can be supplied ($Q_D>Q_S$), and thus a persistent *shortage* is created. This means that producers need to find a way to ration out what little supply they have, whether through *first-come, first-serve* or ration coupons. Those with more money can also illegally buy the product for higher prices (but at higher priority/supply) in *black markets*.

![[Price Ceiling Example.png]]

### Price Floors

*Price floors* (or *price supports*, *wage floors*) are minimum prices fixed by the government (often above the equilibrium price to have an effect), often when society feels that suppliers/producers are underpaid. This creates a constant surplus ($Q_S>Q_D$), which is either remedied by governments through restricting supply, increasing demand, or outright purchasing the surplus themselves (essentially subsidizing; either storing or disposing it).

Price floors can also incentivize producers to continue producing otherwise inefficient/unprofitable products, inefficiently using society's resources and failing to achieve [[#Allocative Efficiency]].


![[Price Floor Example.png]]

# Chapter 4
> Market Failures Caused by Externalities and Asymmetric Information

*Market failure* is a condition in which markets do not allocate resources to optimize for net benefits.

## Surplus
### Consumer Surplus

The difference between the maximum price a consumer is *willing to pay* (illustrated by a demand curve) and how much they *actually pay* (the real price). This means finding the area bounded by the demand curve and price line, above the price line (generally a triangle; $\frac{bh}{2}$). **Consumer surplus is *inversely related* to price**.

![[Consumer Surplus Example.png]]
### Producer Surplus

The difference between the *minimum price a producer would take to produce a good* and how they *actually get paid*. This means finding the area bounded by the supply curve and the price line, below the price line ($\frac{bh}{2}$). Generally this minimum price is the *marginal cost* of producing that unit, being the sum of the costs of the [[#Factors of Production]] needed. Individual producer surpluses may differ depending on their own cost of production. **Producer surplus is *directly* related to price**.

### Total Surplus
Also known as *social surplus*, the sum of consumer and producer surplus. Markets at [[#Equilibrium]] maximize this. It is a good measure of social welfare.

## Deadweight Loss

Also known as *efficiency losses*, the reductions of [[#Total Surplus]] due to overproduction/underproduction. This results in a mismatch of desired prices from consumers and producers, where now the *quantity* is the IV.

![[Deadweight Loss Example.png]]

# Chapter 6
> Elasticity

# Chapter 7
> Utility Maximization

## Marginal and Total Utility

As opposed to simply [[#Utility]], *marginal utility* ($MU$) is the additional or extra satisfaction one derives from purchasing an additional unit of a product. Marginal utility will usually change from one quantity to another, under the [[#Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility]].

*Total utility* ($TU$) is a sum of marginal utility at some specific quantity.

> It can be helpful to think of it in terms of calculus. Marginal utility is the derivative (roughly averaged over an interval of 1 unit) of total utility, and total utility the integral of marginal utility.
> 
> Adding up marginal utility to get total utility boils down to a Riemann Sum. The total utility graph will generally always be a concave down parabola, and marginal utility a downward sloping line, due to the [[#Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility]].

![[Marginal Utility Table.png]]
## Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility

As consumers purchase more and more units of a given product, their marginal utility will always decrease. The more of something one has, the less marginal utility they derive from an additional unit. Sometimes, the marginal utility can even become negative.

This can be used to demonstrate why the demand curve is downward sloping, as marginal utility decreases per additional unit, people will only buy more units if the price falls.

## Utility-Maximizing Rule
$$\frac{MU_1}{P_1}=\frac{MU_1}{P_1}=\frac{MU_3}{P_3}=$$
# Chapter 34
> International Trade

## Why Trade?

1. The distribution of resources among nations is uneven
2. Efficient production requires specialized/expertise with technology
3. Products differ in quality/attributes, so imported goods may be preferred over domestic

> ex. China can mass produce *labor-intensive goods* (for... reasons) like textiles and electronics, Australia can produce *land-intensive goods* such as wool and meat, Mexico has the climate to mass produce produce, and the US can produce *capital-intensive goods* such as vehicles, equipment, and machinery due to its industrialization. With this, each country can specialize in certain products they excel at producing and get the others from each other.

Trade also deters monopolies by promoting competition, with foreign firms competing with domestic, each innovating to find the lowest prices. Trade plays a large role in preventing war, and imported products allow for a wider variety of goods.

## Comparative/Absolute Advantage

*Open economies* (to international trade) produce more of some goods (*exports*) than others (*imports*) than they would if they were a *closed economy*. This is because with trade, becoming increasingly specialized in producing certain goods means that the nation has an *absolute advantage* (as it is a more efficient producer of that good than others, being specialized; **lower per unit cost**) and *comparative advantage* (if it can produce the product at a **lower [[Basic Economic Concepts#Opportunity Cost|Opportunity Cost]]** than others).

With a constant [[Basic Economic Concepts#Production Possibility Curves|PPC]] in mind, the comparative advantage of a country depends on its *opportunity-cost ratio* (*domestic exchange ratio*) of the two goods compared to others. 

The exchange rate between the goods when traded between countries is called the *terms of trade* (*international exchange ratio*). Each party involved wants (but isn't always able to) to get a ratio that is **better** than if they produced it themselves.

### Consumption Possibilities Curve

A modified domestic [[Basic Economic Concepts#Production Possibility Curves|PPC]] illustrating what an economy could get if it specialized in one resource and traded for the other, generally allowing for greater amounts of one resource it couldn't previously reach.

![[Sample CPC.png]]

### Principle of Comparative Advantage
**It is best to specialize in producing goods where you have lower opportunity costs than others.

Some argue that *absolute advantage* is not as necessary as *comparative advantage*, so even countries more productive than others should trade. Even having *absolute disadvantage* still doesn't matter as long as *comparative advantage* exists (better to delegate resource cost to others).

Specialization results in better/efficient resource allocation, and increases the possible amount of resources for all parties involved. The extra resources that can be gained under this (compared to if it were self-sufficient) are called *gains from trade*.

### Trade with Increasing Opportunity Costs

If opportunity costs were to increase with each unit of one good, as it [[Basic Economic Concepts#Law of Increasing Opportunity Cost|usually does]], trade becomes less optimal as each party tries to optimize its production ratio, and the differing ratios that provide trade with its benefits disappear. This leads to less-than-complete specialization, and sometimes domestic products can compete with imported ones.
