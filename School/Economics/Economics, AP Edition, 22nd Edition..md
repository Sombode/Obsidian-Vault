# Chapter 1
> Limits, Alternatives, and Choices

## Scarcity
> [[Basic Economic Concepts#Scarcity|Related Section]]

Society's wants/needs far exceed what it has available, with goods and services in limited supply (called [[#The Economizing Problem]]). Scarcity causes choices, because you "can't have it all." Even if something is "free" to you, someone else bears the cost.

## Utility

**Utility is the measure of satisfaction of a good/service, or the benefit derived from it.** Humans follow "rational self-interest," carefully choosing opportunities to increase utility. Faulty logic or skewed values can affect what people see as "rational," and emotions can be a key factor. This doesn't mean people are inherently selfish, as increasing utility can come from helping others (pleasure from charity work, raising children, etc.).

## Marginal Thinking

Marginal thinking/marginal analysis revolves around thinking of **what comes next**. People consider **changes** in the current system (ex. Should I study an hour more? Should the government increase funding?) by looking at the marginal benefits (MB) and marginal costs (MC) to make rational choices. 

> ex. If you choose to buy a larger diamond, the *marginal cost* is the extra money it will cost, but the *marginal benefit* is the longer pleasure derived from it.

Marginal costs can include [[Basic Economic Concepts#Opportunity Cost|opportunity costs]].

Optimized choices often occur when $MB=MC$

## Scientific Thinking

Economists can rely on the [[Scientific Method]] to rationally produce economic laws/principles, widely accepted/tested general assumptions on economic behaviors. They also simplify the world to better understand it, seen with [[Basic Economic Concepts#Ceteris Paribus|Ceteris Paribus]].

## Types of Economics

### Micro/Macro
> [[Basic Economic Concepts#Microeconomics|Related Section]]

Microeconomics works on the individual scale, focusing on singular/specific objects (products, consumers).

Macroeconomics works on a larger scope, frequently using *aggregates* to represent components of a system (lumping together all people as *consumers*)

### Positive and Normative
> [[Basic Economic Concepts#Positive Economics|Related Section]]

Positive economics works with pure facts and cause-and-effect relationships. 

Normative economics incorporates *value judgements* about recommended actions/*what it ought to be* (more subjunctive).

## The Economizing Problem

People's desires for good/services (be it necessities or luxuries) far exceed their ability to procure them. These unlimited desires are restricted by limited resources, and can be near impossible to truly satiate.

### Budget Lines

Budget lines/constraints can be used to visualize the combinations of two products a consumer can buy with a set budget. *Similar to a [[Basic Economic Concepts#Production Possibility Curves||PPC]] where the resource used is money.*

### Society

Society itself faces an economizing problem, as it has limited resources to allocate and use. These *economic resources* fall under four main categories:
1. Land
	1. Natural resources (forests, oil deposits, water, wind, sunlight, etc.)
2. Labor
	1. Physical action and mental activities of people
3. (Real) Capital
	1. *Captial goods* are the manufactured aids to help in producing consumer goods/services (factories, transport, storage, tools, etc.) 
	2. Spending on this is generally called an *investment*
	3. Money is **NOT** an economic resource
4. Entrepreneurial Ability
	1. A human resource distinct from labor, where *entrepreneurs*:
		1. Take initiative to start producing a good/service
		2. Make strategic business decisions for an enterprise
		3. Innovate, making new products/techniques
		4. Bear risk to bring forth new products/ideas
5. Human Capital
	1. The skills/abilities of people
	2. Commonly education
	3. Sometimes not listed as a economic resource

These resources are called *factors of production*, or *inputs*.

Choosing to produce consumer goods (that immediately satisfy wants) over capital goods help satisfy current wants, but hinders future production capability. Capital goods can help build delayed gratification down the road, leading to greater economic growth in the future.

# Chapter 2
> The Market System and Circular Flow

## Economic Systems

Economic systems are designed to solve a society's [[#The Economizing Problem|Economizing Problem]], differing in (1) who owns factors of production and (2) the method used to motivate, coordinate, and direct economic activity.

The two extreme ends of economic systems are the decentralized *laissez-faire capitalism* ("pure capitalism," minimal government influence, the market directs activity) and the highly centralized *command system* (heavy government influence/control; seen in communist/socialist countries such as the USSR, Cuba, and China; government owns/controls business firms, centralized planning). Most economic systems lie in-between, called *market systems*/*mixed economies* (capitalism, a mix of government initiatives and decentralized actions, buyers and sellers come together at *markets* to conduct activity, many can and will act in self-interest).
