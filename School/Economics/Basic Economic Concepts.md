# What is Economics?
- Social science (deals with people)
	- Generalizations for people as a whole, there will be exceptions
- Working with *limited resources* and *unlimited wants/needs* (scarcity = decisions)
	- You can't have your cake and eat it too ([[Opportunity Cost]])
- Economics is in terms of abstractions
	- Simplified models for the real world
	- Still based on solid facts

## Ceteris Paribus
As life can be so convoluted and complex, focusing on one variable as dynamic and treating everything else as a static constant helps make better sense of things.
> ex. What happens to X when Y changes?

## Scarcity
> There's no such thing as a free lunch.
