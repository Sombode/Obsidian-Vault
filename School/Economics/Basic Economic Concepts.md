# What is Economics?
- Social science (deals with people)
	- Generalizations for people as a whole, there will be exceptions
- Working with *limited resources* and *unlimited wants/needs* ([[#Scarcity]])
	- You can't have your cake and eat it too ([[Opportunity Cost]])
- Economics is in terms of abstractions
	- Simplified models for the real world
	- Still based on solid facts
	- People make decisions in their best interest (not necessarily *selfish*, just *rational*)
	- The status quo matters

## Ceteris Paribus
As life can be so convoluted and complex, focusing on one variable as dynamic and treating everything else as a static constant helps make better sense of things.
> ex. What happens to X when Y changes?

## Scarcity
> There's no such thing as a free lunch.

Scarcity is fundamental to economics, choices must be made. With limited resources, better decisions must be made to make with do with what you have. Time is one of the most scarce/precious resources. 

## Pitfalls to Objectivity
- Bias
	- Always be sure to look out for any potential biases
- Loaded/Emotionally Charged Terminology
	- Think critically
- Definitions
	- Can be slightly different for each person (connotations, etc.)

## Fallacy of Division
>"What's good for the whole is good for the individuals."

Inverse of the [[#Fallacy of Composition]].
## Post Hoc Fallacy
>"Because A happened before B, A *caused* B."

Large in the sports world, "rituals" to increase luck/likelihood of events. Superstitions (like crossing your fingers).

## Correlation vs. Causation
Just because two sets of data are correlated, doesn't mean that one causes the other. There could be external factors that create this correlation, or it could be coincidence.
