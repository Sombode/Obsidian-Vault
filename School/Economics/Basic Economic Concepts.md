# What is Economics?
- Social science (deals with people)
	- Generalizations for people as a whole, there will be exceptions
- Working with *limited resources* and *unlimited wants/needs* ([[#Scarcity]])
	- You can't have your cake and eat it too ([[#Opportunity Cost]])
- Economics is in terms of **abstractions**
	- Simplified models for the real world
	- Still based on solid facts
	- People make decisions in their best interest (not necessarily *selfish*, just *rational*)
	- The status quo matters
- Marginal thinking (what happens *next*?)
- All societies must answer **3 basic questions**:
	- What to Produce?
	- How Much to Produce?
	- For Whom?
		- Distributions of products/profits

## Types of Economics
### Microeconomics
Looks at small, individual markets.
- Individuals
- Households
- Specific Firms

> ex. _Wheat market_ over the US economy/whole agricultural market
### Macroeconomics
Looking at the whole economy, or large general segments of it. Focuses on the aggregate (GDP, all consumers, all businesses, inflation, unemployment, etc.).

### Positive Economics
Looking just at the facts/data. Cleaner/simpler.
> ex. Gas prices are $3.67/gallon.
### Normative Economics
Value judgements, what does X mean? More speculation. What is good, what is bad?
> ex. Gas prices are $3.67/gallon, *which is too high and will make people drive less.*

## Pitfalls to Objectivity
- Bias
	- Always be sure to look out for any potential biases
- Loaded/Emotionally Charged Terminology
	- Think critically
- Definitions
	- Can be slightly different for each person (connotations, etc.)
# Ceteris Paribus
> Keep it simple, stupid.

As life can be so convoluted and complex, focusing on one variable as dynamic and treating everything else as a static constant helps make better sense of things.
> ex. What happens to X when Y changes?

# Scarcity
> There's no such thing as a free lunch.

Scarcity is fundamental to economics, choices must be made. With limited resources, decisions must be made to make with do with what you have. *Time is one of the most scarce/precious resources.*

## Production Possibility Curves

Production possibility curves (PPCs) represent the [[#Opportunity Cost]] of making goods out of scarce resources. Only so much can be produced, and the relationship between

# Opportunity Cost
> You can't have your cake and eat it too.

Saying yes to something also means saying no to something else. Choosing one option puts you out of another. Sometimes it is best to say no to an opportunity and save you cost of time/effort for something not worthwhile. Choosing how to spend time is one of the best examples of this, you can choose to spend it doing X, but that means that you can't do Y in that time.
# Common Fallacies

## Fallacy of Composition
>"What's good for the self is good for the rest."

Inverse of the [[#Fallacy of Division]].
## Fallacy of Division
>"What's good for the whole is good for the individuals."

Inverse of the [[#Fallacy of Composition]].
## Post Hoc Fallacy
>"Because A happened before B, A *caused* B."

Large in the sports world, "rituals" to increase luck/likelihood of events. Superstitions (like crossing your fingers).

## Correlation vs. Causation
Just because two sets of data are correlated, doesn't mean that one causes the other. There could be external factors that create this correlation, or it could be coincidence.
