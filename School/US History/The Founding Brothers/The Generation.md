- While near-impossible to imagine at the time, the American Revolution was bound to happen
- Many American revolutionaries understood its historical significance at the time, recording documents and portraying themselves in a certain way to be preserved and remembered
- The ideals of the American Revolution were bolstered by the many subsequent revolutions in history and the rise of many new governments following American principles
- Still, revolution seemed highly unlikely at the time and many revolutionaries did not fully believe in its success
- If the British been more keen to strike down the revolution in its infancy, it might have failed as a whole and history would be forever different
- Thomas Paine believed that eventually America would evolve into an independent nation, but did not expect it to occur as quickly as it did under revolution
- Looking back on the success of the revolution with hindsight can hamper the miracle that it was at the time, given the military power of the British
- However, hindsight also allows historians to gain a sense of contingency throughout the events and understand patterns that appear
- Thus, a mix of blindness to the future and hindsight must be applied to properly grasp the historical impact of the American revolution
- Due to its isolation from Europe and plentiful natural resources, the American continent was set up to become a large and powerful force
- The principles that the revolution were based on, mainly used to discredit the authority of Parliament, would also undermine the authority of any central government in the new American nation; this is seen as the government under the Articles was highly decentralized
- America had great potential in the long-run, but few hopes in the short-run
- To ensure a central government, the Constitutional Convention took place in 1787 and drafted a new document to accommodate republican principles
- While criticized by some for not achieving its original purpose of revising the Articles and also bypassing the normal process for ratification, the Constitution also created a centralized government while staying true to republican principles
- The creation of the Constitution in 1787 can be seen as the second "founding" of the nation, no longer just proclaiming independence but also nationhood
- Uncertainty was prevalent throughout the convention, seen in the many compromises and ambiguity in the resulting Constitution
- An "American people" did not exist for a long time, with terms such as "American" and "democrat" being mostly insulting terms for a while
- Assets of the American Revolution:
	- Bountiful natural resources
	- Geographic isolation
	- Young and large population (4 million people)
	- Broad distribution of property (among whites)
	- Commitment to republican principles
	- Popular support for the first chief executive
	- George Washington
- Liabilities of the American Revolution:
	- Republican government on this scale is a new and untested concept
	- The principles of the revolution undermined any centralized government
	- The states had been largely separate and isolated, with little common history to bind them together
	- A large amount of the American population was black slaves, especially in the Chesapeake region and the south
- The first decade of the American nation is arguably the most influential, with certain choices made during this period setting up consequences such as the Civil War and America's emergence as a world power
- People either view the period surrounding America's founding positively or negatively depending on their opinions on the nation's current state, and many scholars seek to uncover the different viewpoints that may have existed at the time
- Despite this, most of the institutions were shaped by a small group of interconnected figures 
- This group of mostly white males emerged under the pressures of the revolution to support the infantile nation, and became America's first natural aristocracy
