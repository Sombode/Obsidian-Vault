- On 2/2/1790, 2 Quaker delegates brought forth a petition to the House calling for the slave trade to be immediately interrupted
- Their petition was highly hindered by the fact that Quakers did not directly participate in the American Revolution
- Furthermore, Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution already prohibited tampering with the slave trade until 1808
- The real purpose of the petition was to convince people toward ending slavery itself
