- On 2/2/1790, 2 Quaker delegates brought forth a petition to the House calling for the slave trade to be immediately interrupted
- Their petition was highly hindered by the fact that Quakers did not directly participate in the American Revolution
- Furthermore, Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution already prohibited tampering with the slave trade until 1808
- The real purpose of the petition was to convince people toward ending slavery itself
- Agitation in Congress over the petition only led to wider notice of the issue, so the best course of action would've been to send it to committee and ignore it
- However, on 2/12/1790 the Pennsylvania Abolition Society, backed by Benjamin Franklin, sent another petition to abolish slavery
- This petition only brought more attention to the issue of slavery, making it impossible to ignore
- The Constitution itself stayed vague around the topic of slavery, allowing states to decide for themselves how to handle the issue
- Petitioners argued that while the slave trade was off-limits, abolishing slavery was never restricted
- However, Southern representatives argued that the Bible was proslavery, the Constitution's evasion of the topic implied acceptance, and that nearly everybody's livelihood in the South depended on slave labor for farming
- Northern representatives cited the principles of the Declaration of Independence to demonstrate the contradiction to American values
