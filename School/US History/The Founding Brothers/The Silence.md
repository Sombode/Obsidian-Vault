- On 2/2/1790, 2 Quaker delegates brought forth a petition to the House calling for the slave trade to be immediately interrupted
- Their petition was highly hindered by the fact that Quakers did not directly participate in the American Revolution
- Furthermore, Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution already prohibited tampering with the slave trade until 1808
- The real purpose of the petition was to convince people toward ending slavery itself
- Agitation in Congress over the petition only led to wider notice of the issue, so the best course of action would've been to send it to committee and ignore it
- However, on 2/12/1790 the Pennsylvania Abolition Society, backed by Benjamin Franklin, sent another petition to abolish slavery
- This petition only brought more attention to the issue of slavery, making it impossible to ignore
- The Constitution itself stayed vague around the topic of slavery, allowing states to decide for themselves how to handle the issue
- Petitioners argued that while the slave trade was off-limits, abolishing slavery was never restricted
- However, Southern representatives argued that the Bible was proslavery, the Constitution's evasion of the topic implied acceptance, and that nearly everybody's livelihood in the South depended on slave labor for farming
- Northern representatives cited the principles of the Declaration of Independence and other parts of the Bible to be clearly antislavery
- Some Northerners saw slavery as a poor curse put on Southerners, being tricked into employing it and unable to escape it
- They proposed a tax that would compensate slaveowners for their slaves, but the amount required would be too large to feasibly implement
- While the North and South were polarized, Virginia had a mix of both viewpoints
- One Virginian delegate pushed that the slaves need to maintain hope for their eventual emancipation, otherwise revolts would occur
- While immediate action on slavery was not allowed, some believed it would be beneficial to discuss the future of slavery
- The inability to take any decisive action regarding slavery would be the central problem following the American Revolution and preceding the Civil War
- Many saw the abolition of slavery as inevitable given the egalitarian principles of the American Revolution, though little real action was seen to achieve it
- Small victories were seen in northern states as Vermont, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Connecticut implemented some antislavery provisions, whether outright banning it or gradually reducing it
- Progress was seen in Virginia as the legislature in 1782 allowed slaveowners to free their slaves, being seen as the start of an abolition movement across the South
- However, this progress on the front of abolition ultimately proved unfruitful, with slavery still too ingrained in the fabric of Southern society to be easily removed
- While the exigence of the American Revolution was direct and immediate in its goals, the push for abolition was less supported as it proved less of an immediate threat
- Many slaveowners argued that their right to own and dispose of their own property protected their rights to slaves
- The polarization between the North and South over slavery proved to be one of the most fundamental divisions plaguing the Constitutional Convention
- Northern delegates demanded immediate assurance that slavery would be abolished, while Southern delegates wished for greater access to slave importation and permanent protections for slavery in the Constitution
- The South wielded great bargaining power due to its threats of leaving the union, utilized during the Nullification Crisis in 1832 and Civil War in 1861
- The result was two main compromises, with the first being one of the last acts of the Confederation, passing the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 that included a part banning slavery in land north of the Ohio River
- This could be (and was) seen as a victory for both sides: for abolitionists it was a concrete step towards emancipation, for slaveowners it tacitly acknowledged and approved slavery south of the river
- The second compromise (the "Sectional Compromise") was one where New England and the Deep South log rolled for an extension of the slave trade for 20 years in exchange for federal regulation of commerce to only require a majority vote (over a supermajority)
- Northerners were ultimately disappointed by the concessions to slavery, and Southerners interpreted the compromises as security for slavery's continuance
- Interestingly, many Virginians were opposed to the slave trade, but demanded protections for slavery
- Virginia was already heavily stocked with slaves, and thus their opposition to further imports made economic sense
- When the committee finally made its decision regarding the petitions, one of the most comprehensive lists of proslavery rhetoric and arguments came before Congress:
	- The many concessions to slavery had not yet been fully fulfilled, and thus action on slavery would be betraying the South
	- Slavery was deeply embedded into Southern culture
	- If anything, the British should be to blame for beginning to implement slavery; slaveowners today do not willfully partake but must ("a necessary evil")
	- Slavery was already part of African tribal culture
	- Freeing slaves meant either incorporating them into an already racially prejudiced society or giving them separate land to colonize
- This speech served to concretely and openly state what was only implicitly said before, and the racial arguments attempted to pit white people against black
- While slavery's arguments bolstered the racial prejudice in many Americans, it had already existed in the country for many years prior
- As the debates were going on, the first census of 1790 was being collected, offering insights into the Northern rejection of and Southern proliferation of slavery
- It became evident that at a certain level of black people in a state, slavery was used to enforce racial segregation
- The census showed that slave populations were not bound to die out anytime soon, crushing the few hopes that Northerners used to assure themselves
- The exponential growth of slave populations meant that the longer people waited, the more burdensome and difficult it would be to end slavery as a whole
- The supposed unfeasibility of any proposed abolition plan led to many believing in the permeance of slavery, however plans for gradual emancipation were still being developed
- Many plans involved compensating slaveowners for their slaves economically and transporting the freed slaves to a colony elsewhere, such as Sierra Leone or west America; they would spread out the economic costs over a series of years
- While the North had already implemented emancipation, they did not have to worry about integrating freed men into society, as they had few slaves; the South did have to worry about creating the first genuinely biracial society
- Implementing any such plan would require a large-scale and federal effort, which may be attacked by those interpreting the ideals of the revolution
- Benjamin Franklin had been a staple of American history, present at many landmark events such as the Continental Congress
- Despite initially supporting the Stamp Act and spending time in London, Franklin quickly joined the American Revolution and was integral in securing an alliance with France
- Near the end of his life, Franklin spearheaded the Pennsylvania Abolition Society and became prominently antislavery (even if he owned a few slaves at one point), publishing antislavery texts and supporting other abolitionists
- With Franklin's support, many northern representatives were emboldened to push the issue of emancipation and abolition further, challenging and questioning the Deep South
- While many other revolutionary figures, such as John Adams, Alexander Hamilton, and George Washington protested slavery, they did little in terms of progressing abolition in Congress
- James Madison's opinion on the topic was much more convoluted, being that of his fellow Virginians in that he opposed the slave trade adamantly but pushed for the preservation of slavery
- To hide this inherent hypocrisy, Madison would write about slavery in an obscure and circumlocutory way, but also tried to push slavery out of discussion whenever possible
- Madison's subtle influence in the Congress became evident when some previously antislavery representatives turned more sympathetic to the South
- When the committee finally sent out its report on the petitions, it pushed for the protection of slavery until 1808, and was sent to the whole of The House for revision
