- On 2/2/1790, 2 Quaker delegates brought forth a petition to the House calling for the slave trade to be immediately interrupted
- Their petition was highly hindered by the fact that Quakers did not directly participate in the American Revolution
- Furthermore, Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution already prohibited tampering with the slave trade until 1808
- The real purpose of the petition was to convince people toward ending slavery itself
- Agitation in Congress over the petition only led to wider notice of the issue, so the best course of action would've been to send it to committee and ignore it
- However, on 2/12/1790 the Pennsylvania Abolition Society, backed by Benjamin Franklin, sent another petition to abolish slavery
- This petition only brought more attention to the issue of slavery, making it impossible to ignore
- The Constitution itself stayed vague around the topic of slavery, allowing states to decide for themselves how to handle the issue
- Petitioners argued that while the slave trade was off-limits, abolishing slavery was never restricted
- However, Southern representatives argued that the Bible was proslavery, the Constitution's evasion of the topic implied acceptance, and that nearly everybody's livelihood in the South depended on slave labor for farming
- Northern representatives cited the principles of the Declaration of Independence and other parts of the Bible to be clearly antislavery
- Some Northerners saw slavery as a poor curse put on Southerners, being tricked into employing it and unable to escape it
- They proposed a tax that would compensate slaveowners for their slaves, but the amount required would be too large to feasibly implement
- While the North and South were polarized, Virginia had a mix of both viewpoints
- One Virginian delegate pushed that the slaves need to maintain hope for their eventual emancipation, otherwise revolts would occur
- While immediate action on slavery was not allowed, some believed it would be beneficial to discuss the future of slavery
- Ultimately, the petitions were passed on to a committee, and later disappeared from mainstream discussion
- The inability to take any decisive action regarding slavery would be the central problem following the American Revolution and preceding the Civil War
- Many saw the abolition of slavery as inevitable given the egalitarian principles of the American Revolution, though little real action was seen to achieve it
- Small victories were seen in northern states as Vermont, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Connecticut implemented some antislavery provisions, whether outright banning it or gradually reducing it
- Progress was seen in Virginia as the legislature in 1782 allowed slaveowners to free their slaves, being seen as the start of an abolition movement across the South
- However, this progress on the front of abolition ultimately proved unfruitful, with slavery still too ingrained in the fabric of Southern society to be easily removed
- While the exigence of the American Revolution was direct and immediate in its goals, the push for abolition was less supported as it proved less of an immediate threat
- Many slaveowners argued that their right to own and dispose of their own property protected their rights to slaves
- The polarization between the North and South over slavery proved to be one of the most fundamental divisions plaguing the Constitutional Convention
- Northern delegates demanded immediate assurance that slavery would be abolished, while Southern delegates wished for greater access to slave importation and permanent protections for slavery in the Constitution
- The South wielded great bargaining power due to its threats of leaving the union, utilized during the Nullification Crisis in 1832 and Civil War in 1861
- The result was two main compromises, with the first being one of the last acts of the Confederation, passing the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 that included a part banning slavery in land north of the Ohio River
- This could be (and was) seen as a victory for both sides: for abolitionists it was a concrete step towards emancipation, for slaveowners it tacitly acknowledged and approved slavery south of the river
- The second compromise was one where New England and the Deep South log rolled for an extension of the slave trade for 20 years in exchange for federal regulation of commerce to only require a majority
