- Due to his exploits in the American Revolution and impact in founding the country, George Washington is heavily revered as an almost mythical figure, seen as the "Father of the Country"
- After becoming so accustomed to having Washington as a central figure in the country, when he published his Farewell Address on September 19, 1796 (in preparation for the coming election of the next executive), people were shocked that he was retiring
- Washington's Farewell Address became a landmark document alongside the Declaration of Independence and Gettysburg Address, though may have been written by Hamilton
- With Washington stepping down after two terms of presidency (a precedent followed by most future presidents), party politics flared with the prospect of the first contested presidential election; this action also signaled a departure from European monarchy as the power of the executive would routinely shift hands
- While Washington, like many other revolutionary leaders, had been considering (and even threatening) retiring from the busy life of politics to isolation and solace, he only decided to retire now due to his growing age and thus diminishing physical vigor (which was one of his stronger assets)
- For most of his career, Washington maintained excellent physical health and sustained few if any injuries; however, he would become ill before the Constitutional Convention in 1787 and again in 1790, nearly dying and marking his physical decline
- Not only would his physical vigor decline, but so would his mental drive and energy not just from age but also from opposition in politics and the press (which superficially did not affect him but did deeply nag at him)
- The principal complaint against Washington was that he essentially turned himself into somewhat of a monarch both in power and in behavior
- The nature of the Revolution required a figurehead to stabilize and focus energy, and Washington had assumed that role as the first "republican king"
- However, another lasting legacy of the Revolution was a deep and intrinsic hatred of monarchs, which placed Washington's position in a precarious place
- Washington was so effective in his duties as a singular actor in the government that most attacks against the government became inherently aimed at him
- It was through his voluntary resignation that Washington assured critics that he would not become like every other monarch
- The main messages/advice Washington gave in his Farewell Address are:
	- National unity is extremely important
	- Dissolving into political parties (or other groups) with sectional interests hinders cooperation
	- America should remain neutral and away from European affairs/politics
- Overall, Washington advocated for unification locally and isolation globally
- While initially people focused on Washington's advocacy for American isolationism, later on people have begun to closely examine his arguments against parties
- What made his messages so important were that they came from his personal experiences in the Revolution
- Washington's venerable resignation of the role of president mirrors that of his resignation from the role of commander of the Continental Army in 1783 (following his rejecting of a scheme to overthrow Congress)
- Washington's push for national unity came from his realization that his first battles in the Revolution over land were meaningless, as keeping the Continental Army together and fighting was all that truly mattered (Britain was fighting from an ocean away, time and space was on their side)
- A hard realist, Washington was highly suspect that anything based solely off of ideals could ever function; he would be cold and ruthless in his decision-making
- Washington understood the allure and appeal of power, and thus understood that no permanent international alliance could last, only permanent national interests (which is why he advocated American isolationism)
- Washington's vision of the American continent, as shown in his Circular Letter of 1783, was one where the bountiful land (westward) was free for American colonization and expansion (with little resistance from either natives or the Spanish) designed to highlight the pinnacle of mankind's potential; thus he feared any possible way that foreign intervention could ruin his vision
- Washington also acknowledged the intellectual bounty provided by the Enlightenment, providing the insights and understanding of human rights necessary to ensure a happy and prosperous nation
- Washington understood that the future of America lay in the unclaimed land to the west, and as such devoted much of his time and energy in planning to expand westward; though many feared expansion could spark conflict
- Washington's views on foreign policy were exemplified with the 1793 Proclamation of Neutrality, which stated that America was an impartial witness to the European conflict between England and France
- He believed that their geographic isolation would allow them to build up the necessary population and resources to handle and overcome foreign opposition, if only Americans bide their time and isolate themselves from foreign policy ("enlightened procrastination")
- However, there was debate over what exactly isolationism meant in terms of policy, which came to a head over (Chief Justice) Jay's Treaty in 1794, which avoided another war with England in exchange for several concessions (tariffs on exports, debt compensation, acknowledgement of supremacy...)
- While the treaty had several long-term benefits, Americans saw its conditions as a rejection of Revolutionary ideals and independence, sparking violent protest
- Despite initial and heavy opposition in the House, Washington's popularity slowly swayed Congress to its ultimate decision of passing the treaty
- In Jefferson's eyes, the future of isolationism meant eliminating monarchy in its entirety to give way to a new age of political rule (the Revolution was merely the beginning); he saw Washington's moves as those of a monarch and feared Hamilton's consolidation of power as proposed in his financial plans, believing a conspiracy of powerful players coming together to take over and destroy the United States
- The brutal suppression of the Pennsylvanian Whiskey Rebellion (against excise taxes on whiskey) by the militia only supported Jefferson's fears, that Washington was becoming senile and oblivious to the takeover of the federal government by conspirators
- Despite the heavy bloodshed, Jefferson wholeheartedly supported the French Revolution as the next step toward defeating the ancient practice of monarchy, symbolized by the old enemy of England; he believed that Washington has led America toward the wrong side of the battle by "siding" with England and becoming an enemy of the French
- Washington became frustrated with Jefferson's spreading of rumors about his incompetence, and soon they stopped corresponding with each other
- Washington saw decisions by the executive to be final and to be accepted by the people, while Jefferson supported outright and even violent protest against them if they violated principles of the Revolution
- Jefferson's ideas rubbed off on others, such as James Monroe and Edmund Randolph (Jefferson's successor as secretary of state); both would assure France of popular American support and action once corruption/conspiracy in the government was removed
- With all of the rumors circulating his senility, Washington resolved to use his Farewell Address to set forth his very much intact control and vision of the future of the Revolution (being a united people under the Revolutionary principles)
