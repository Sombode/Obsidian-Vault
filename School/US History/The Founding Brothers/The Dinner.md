- Outside of Washington's house, Jefferson encountered a dejected Hamilton broken over the gridlock placed over his financial plans by Madison (opposing the provision about the national assumption of state debts)
- Seeing as Hamilton planned to resign over his defeat, Jefferson hoped to reconcile things between him and Madison
- According to Jefferson, he organized a dinner party on June 20, 1790, where the two could hash things out, and eventually Madison allowed the economic plan to pass to a vote in exchange for the national capital to be situated along the Potomac River
- While the dinner party did occur, it is unsure if any such agreement was brokered
- Jefferson believed that the paralysis caused by debate over Hamilton's plan could ruin the unity of the new nation, so despite his opposition to it he felt it was necessary to strike a deal and pass it
- In retrospect, Jefferson would come to regret his actions in allowing the plan to pass
- While the validity of Jefferson's story is backed by evidence, many historians believe it is only part of a much bigger picture
- Madison had earned his reputation as a popular and powerful politician through his push for a strong national government and ability to convince, despite (or perhaps due to) his meager appearance
- Many people today know Madison as working together with Jefferson, working out the details as Jefferson looked at the big picture; this view would overlook Madison's own power and influence
- However, at the time of the dinner party, Hamilton was Madison's close co-conspirator, working together on *The Federalist Papers* and consulting each other for advice (principally Hamilton seeking advice while drafting his financial plans)
- It was only a few months prior to the dinner party that Madison switched from advocating for nationalism back to the original revolutionary faith of Virginia
- Madison was troubled by Hamilton's plans to reimburse those to whom the government owed money as the public sought to take advantage of it
	- Many veterans who were originally given the securities as payment for their service had sold them off at a fraction of their value
	- Upon learning of Hamilton's plan, many investors stocked up on securities to try and secure a large profit
- Madison came out against Hamilton's plan, arguing to create a compromise between the original holders and current holders of the securities, but was denied in the House
- The plan would also shoulder the debt of some states on others who had already paid off most of theirs, such as Virginia (and many other Southern states)
- Madison also came to see the assumption of state debts as a way for the national government to subtly gain control over state economies as well
- While accused of threatening the unity of the nation by the North, Madison was propelled by the South to reject Hamilton's plans that pushed to consolidate more of the states' power into the new government
- Hamilton's approach lacked the seeming subtly of Madison's, glossing over opposing arguments and throwing his force aggressively toward overcoming any obstacles, perhaps a product of his insecurities
- In his 3-month frenzy writing his *Report on the Public Credit*, Hamilton channeled his economic expertise to create what he hoped would untangle the mess of the US economy
- To Hamilton, the issue over the original holders of securities having given them away was their problem, not his
- Madison's seemingly sudden switch from advocating for a strong national government to opposing Hamilton's plans struck him as illogical, considering their previous collaborations
- The implicit assumptions and authoritative ethos used in his report only served to further discomfort opposition
- Hamilton proposed that the government needed to take action to oversee the extraction of the bountiful natural resources in America so that the economy could prosper
- Thinking economically, Hamilton preferred for the nation's wealth to be consolidated in a few so that it could be employed as capital instead of simply money (politically, consolidation was a scary subject for most)
- Having been brought into the spotlight by the urban elite (merchants, bankers, business leaders), Hamilton's plans implicitly endorsed them and attempted to channel their talents toward the public good (which could be construed as some as making the rich richer)
- However to many, the true wealth was in land, not capital; the urban elite were simply middlemen with little contribution to society that bled others dry with interest rates (as many British and Scottish creditors were doing to them)
- Many of the founding fathers found themselves in a precarious position, with Jefferson focused on personal matters, Madison suffering from dysentery, and Washington down with what some considered to be a life-threatening flu
	- This caused most of the nation to be on edge and jeopardized the stability of the nation
- Jefferson acknowledged his lack of expertise surrounding the feud between Hamilton and Madison, and himself had little interest in retaining public office (after a poor track record as governor as Virginia, he only accepted a position because Washington asked him to)
- Jefferson would host and mediate the dinner party due to his personal aversion to conflict and role in foreign affairs (with large debts, the nation would not be taken seriously by others)
- The Constitutional responsibility of choosing a location for the capital created plenty of tension in Congress, with states either arguing for it to be situated within their borders or bargaining with other states for votes (which Madison dubbed the "Big Knife")
- A plethora of candidates emerged (16), many biased toward Pennsylvania due to its centrality, but the opposition for any single one was adamant
- Madison, however, argued for the capital to be situated along the Potomac, claiming that it was the *demographic* center of the country and that the Potomac provided a direct route westward to Ohio, which the Susquehanna lacked
- Unfortunately, many of the navigational possibilities of the Potomac (which mostly Virginians believed in) were either overstated or simply misleading; any hope for the Potomac as the capital's location was quickly fading
- Jefferson's dinner was not the only secret meeting of its kind, with one such meeting on June 15 securing Philadelphia as the temporary location for the capital until the permanent one was settled (many feared the temporary would become the permanent; this revived hopes for the Potomac river)
- The decision reached at Jefferson's dinner was the culmination of many prior discussions, though this fact is glossed over in his account
- In fact, votes for the Potomac as the capital had already been secured, Hamilton only prevented any opposition from truly stopping the decision; the main issue of the meeting was to recalculate Virginia's debt and thus how much they would have to owe (Hamilton would subtly manipulate the numbers to appease Virginians so that they ended up with no net change)
- The public was shocked by the Potomac's victory seemingly out-of-nowhere and were quick to criticize the decision as a purely political maneuver given the large undeveloped wilderness that was chosen
- Despite the westward access Madison claimed the Potomac offered, Washington would choose a more eastward location to build the capital (which he was urged should happen sooner rather than later as many believed the Residency Bill would be repealed in favor of Philadelphia)
- Although Madison compromised with the debt assumption, there was still vehement backlash in Virginia, with subtle threats of secession appearing to threaten the union
- The compromise reached in Jefferson's dinner party reflects the larger theme of debate and argument between opposing factions in the government
- In part due to its large population and economy, Virginia had considerable sway in the government, not mentioning the fact that it was now the seat of the nation's capital
- The geographic isolation and thus undeveloped and almost rural nature of the capital helped assure people afraid of the encroachment of a large, consolidated federal government
- Furthermore, the almost agrarian landscape separated the political and economic capitals the the US, unlike most European capitals
