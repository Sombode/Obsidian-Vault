- Outside of Washington's house, Jefferson encountered a dejected Hamilton broken over the gridlock placed over his financial plans by Madison (opposing the provision about the national assumption of state debts)
- Seeing as Hamilton planned to resign over his defeat, Jefferson hoped to reconcile things between him and Madison
- According to Jefferson, he organized a dinner party on June 20, 1790, where the two could hash things out, and eventually Madison allowed the economic plan to pass to a vote in exchange for the national capital to be situated along the Potomac River
- While the dinner party did occur, it is unsure if any such agreement was brokered
- Jefferson believed that the paralysis caused by debate over Hamilton's plan could ruin the unity of the new nation, so despite his opposition to it he felt it was necessary to strike a deal and pass it
- In retrospect, Jefferson would come to regret his actions in allowing the plan to pass
- While the validity of Jefferson's story is backed by evidence, many historians believe it is only part of a much bigger picture
- Madison had earned his reputation as a popular and powerful politician through his push for a strong national government and ability to convince, despite (or perhaps due to) his meager appearance
- Many people today know Madison as working together with Jefferson, working out the details as Jefferson looked at the big picture; this view would overlook Madison's own power and influence
- However, at the time of the dinner party, Hamilton was Madison's close co-conspirator, working together on *The Federalist Papers* and consulting each other for advice (principally Hamilton seeking advice while drafting his financial plans)
- It was only a few months prior to the dinner party that Madison switched from advocating for nationalism back to the original revolutionary faith of Virginia
- Madison was troubled by Hamilton's plans to reimburse those to whom the government owed money as the public sought to take advantage of it
	- Many veterans who were originally given the securities as payment for their service had sold them off at a fraction of their value
	- Upon learning of Hamilton's plan, many investors stocked up on securities to try and secure a large profit
- Madison came out against Hamilton's plan, arguing to create a compromise between the original holders and current holders of the securities, but was denied in the House
- The plan would also shoulder the debt of some states on others who had already paid off most of theirs, such as Virginia (and many other Southern states)
- Madison also came to see the assumption of state debts as a way for the national government to subtly gain control over state economies as well
- While accused of threatening the unity of the nation by the North, Madison was propelled by the South to reject Hamilton's plans that pushed to consolidate more of the states into the new government
