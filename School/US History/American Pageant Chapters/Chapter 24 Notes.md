# Chapter 24
Industry Comes of Age (1865 - 1900)

## The Iron Colt Becomes an Iron Horse

The U.S. begins to expand its railroad network in the late 1800s. The high costs/risks of railroad construction leads to heavy government subsidies. Many railroads are built on public land (taken from natives) given to railroad companies.

## Spanning the Continent with Rails

In 1862, the *Union Pacific Railroad* was contracted by Congress to build part of a *transcontinental railroad* starting in Omaha, Nebraska. The *Central Pacific Railroad* company started building the other side in San Francisco, California. Central Pacific Railroad had four main financial backers (the *Big Four*), including Leland Stanford and Collis P. Huntington.

The transcontinental railroad would be completed in 1869, opening up westward expansion and increasing Asian trade.
