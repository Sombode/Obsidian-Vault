Industry Comes of Age (1865 - 1900)

## The Iron Colt Becomes an Iron Horse

The U.S. begins to expand its railroad network in the late 1800s. The high costs/risks of railroad construction leads to heavy government subsidies. Many railroads are built on public land (taken from natives) given to railroad companies.

## Spanning the Continent with Rails

In 1862, the Union Pacific Railroad was contracted by Congress to build a transcontinental railroad from Omaha, Nebraska to San Francisco, California.
