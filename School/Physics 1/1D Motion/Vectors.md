Much like a [[Scalars]], but vectors (formally *vector quantities* ) have both *magnitude* and *direction*.

> ex. 5 m **East**, +8 m (having a +/- indicates direction, otherwise a scalar), -12 m/s

The direction of a vector is either positive (North, East, Up, Right) or negative (South, West, Down, Left).

Vectors do not have to indicate movement, just direction.

When comparing negative vectors (i.e. discussing which represents a larger velocity), compare the magnitudes (ignore signs).
