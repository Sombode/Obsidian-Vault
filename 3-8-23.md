# Variable Costs
> (continued from yesterday)

- Based on production (**will increase as production increases**)
	- You need more resources to produce more output
	- As more labor is added, diminishing returns creates higher costs (*The Law of Diminishing Returns*)
- Determine if a company continues to produce
	- If a business cannot cover the additional variable costs from another unit of a product (*marginal cost*), it will close
- **In the long run, all costs will become variable**

> ex. Electricity is a variable cost, as electricity bills will flucuate based on usage (which can be tied to production). Other variable costs include the cost of resources and distribution/transportation.

# Total Costs
$$TC=FC+VC$$

- Total costs are fixed costs plus variable costs
- Total cost is parallel to variable costs (as fixed cost is just a constant offset between the two)
- **In the long run, variable costs are equal to total costs** (as all costs become variable)

# Average Costs

- Average fixed cost ($AFC$) becomes smaller as output increases (same amount over a larger interval)
- Average variable cost ($AVC$) initially becomes smaller, but then increases (diminishing returns after a certain point)
- Average total cost "shadows" AVC, the difference between the two being AFC

# Marginal Cost
$$MC=\frac{\Delta VC}{\Delta Q}$$
$$MC=\frac{\Delta TC}{\Delta Q}$$

- The additional cost from one output to another (you can use either change in VC or change in TC)
	- This does not work with average costs
- It will also initially decrease, then begin to increase (due to diminishing returns)

# Graphical Analysis
> Price per unit on the Y-Axis ($), quantity on the X-Axis (Q)

- AVC is "U" shaped
- ATC shadows AVC (similar shape)
- MC is "J" shaped, where it initially drops before quickly climbing (like part of a parabola)
	- The initial dip is not always there/shown
	- MC partly mimics the shape of the supply curve
- MC intersects ATC at its minimum (also works with AVC)
- Where $MC=ATC$, productive efficiency is reached
	- However, this does not imply that a business should operate here
	- They will produce zero profit
	- Businesses seek to maximize profit, not efficiency
		- Demand is needed to determine revenue (and thus profit)
- Where $MC=AVC$, the business will gain nothing (called its *shut-down point*)
	- It is the lowest point at which it will produce, anything below this it will shut down
	- The business will be losing the same amount of money as if it just shut down and paid only its fixed costs (hence its name)
