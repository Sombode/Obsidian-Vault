When energy hits an earth surface feature, it is either **reflected**, **absorbed**, or **transmitted**.

$$E_I(λ) = E_R(λ)+E_A(λ)+E_T(λ)$$
Where $E_I(λ)$ is incident energy, $E_R(λ)$ is reflected, $E_A(λ)$ is absorbed, $E_T(λ)$ is transmitted.

As reflected energy is most important to remote sensing:
$$E_R(λ) = E_I(λ)-[E_A(λ)+E_T(λ)]$$
## Reflection

Geometrically, objects reflect energy on a scale of **specular** to **diffuse** (also called a "Lambertian surface"). Ideal specular reflectors are
