When energy hits an earth surface feature, it is either **reflected**, **absorbed**, or **transmitted**.

$$E_I(λ) = E_R(λ)+E_A(λ)+E_T(λ)$$
Where $E_I(λ)$ is incident energy, $E_R(λ)$ is reflected, $E_A(λ)$ is absorbed, $E_T(λ)$ is transmitted.

As reflected energy is most important to remote sensing:
$$E_R(λ) = E_I(λ)-[E_A(λ)+E_T(λ)]$$
Surface features affect different wavelengths differently, causing color differences among other effects. Two objects may seem the same in one wavelength, but another can be used to differentiate them.
## Reflection

Geometrically, objects reflect energy on a scale of **specular** to **diffuse** (also called a *"Lambertian surface"*). **Ideal specular reflectors** are mirror like in reflecting energy, near-perfect have slight diffusion in other directions. **Ideal diffuse reflectors** (*"Lambertian surfaces"*) spread out the energy in all directions equally, near-perfect are generally equal except for being slightly more concentrated at the angle of reflection. Many surface features are neither of the two extremes, but in between and near-perfect.

Diffuse reflection contains color information, and is most helpful in remote sensing.

$$p_λ=\frac{E_R(λ)}{E_I(λ)}$$
Where $p_λ$ is a percentage of *spectral reflectance*, which for objects can be graphed on a *spectral reflectance curve*
