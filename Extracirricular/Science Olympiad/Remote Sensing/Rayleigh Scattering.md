Rayleigh Scattering occurs between radiation and particles **smaller** than their wavelength. The effect is inversely proportional to $Î»^4$ , making shorter wavelengths much more likely to be scattered.

Blue skies are the result of Rayleigh Scattering, as the shorter blue wavelengths are scattered more by the atmosphere. However, as sunset/sunrise occurs, the path length of the radiation is so much higher that the blue light is almost completely scattered, leaving behind only red/orange colors to see.

Rayleigh Scattering is a main cause of hazy images, diminishing the crispness or contrast of an image. A bluish tint on images due to this can be remedied via filtering out short wavelengths at the lens.
