The Taconian Orogeny occurred in the late Ordovician (~460 Ma)

# Why "Taconic Orogeny" is a Misnomer

The Taconian Orogeny is named after the *Taconian Mountains* which formed as a result, an Alpine-scale Ordovician mountain chain with peaks up to 4,000 m and stretching from Canada to Alabama. These mountains are long since eroded, with the new *Taconic mountains* now in their place. The Taconic mountains are much newer and smaller, with a maximum elevation of only 600 m and only spanning roughly 20 km of New York.
