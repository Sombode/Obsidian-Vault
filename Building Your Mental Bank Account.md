> CVSO Confidence Camp Lesson 1

- Mindset is the key to becoming an elite team (pushing our limits)
	- We have the talent, we have the passion, we have the effort
- Flea Analogy (psuedoscience but helpful):
	- Put jumping fleas in a sealed jar, and they'll only jump as high as the jar
	- Even if you remove the lid, they won't jump out
	- **You must change your mindset to jump past your preconceived barriers**
	- You can always get out of jars
		- We've gotten past many jars in the past (regionals, states, etc.)
- "Confidence is the feeling that you can do something (or that you know something) so well that you do not have to think about how to do it when you are doing it. That skill or knowledge is in you, it's part of you, and it will come out when needed if you let it."

- Most of this information comes from *The Confident Mind* by Dr. Nate Zinsser (sports psychologist)
