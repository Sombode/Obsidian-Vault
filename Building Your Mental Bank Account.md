> CVSO Confidence Camp Lesson 1

- Most of this information comes from *The Confident Mind* by Dr. Nate Zinsser (sports psychologist)

- Mindset is the key to becoming an elite team (pushing our limits)
	- We have the talent, we have the passion, we have the effort
- Flea Analogy (psuedoscience but helpful):
	- Put jumping fleas in a sealed jar, and they'll only jump as high as the jar
	- Even if you remove the lid, they won't jump out
	- **You must change your mindset to jump past your preconceived barriers**
	- You can always get out of jars
		- We've gotten past many jars in the past (regionals, states, etc.)
- "Confidence is the feeling that you can do something (or that you know something) so well that you do not have to think about how to do it when you are doing it. That skill or knowledge is in you, it's part of you, and it will come out when needed if you let it."
- "Confidence is not the absence of doubt, but confidence is the way in which you respond to doubt."
- Everyone experiences doubt, but the difference is in how some can prevent doubt from impacting their confidence
- Garden Analogy
	- Maintaining confidence is like maintaining a garden
	- It takes daily work to cultivate confidence
	- You must pluck out the weeds of doubt (everyone must pluck them out)
	- The people who put the most effort into cultivation see the most fruit
- **Confidence is not arrogance, confidence is calmness**
- "You must get out of your own way and remove hesitation"
- There is not much difference in how to approach a mental task vs. a physical task
- **You must trust yourself to perform in order to perform**

# The First Victory

- Before you can win in the real world, you must win the *first victory* in your mind
- It takes confidence and quality effort to win the first victory

# The Mental Bank Account

- The mental bank account stores the good feelings from previous accomplishments
- These accumulated positive feelings can be retrieved to handle a new struggle
