# Costs of Production
> This is the bulk of the AP test! Pretty scary stuff.

Focusing more on **supply** over **demand**.

## Key Points
- Scarcity (Finite resources)
- PPC (What can you make, connected to scarcity; bowed out)
- [[#Productivity]] (Outputs:Inputs)

## Productivity

- Producing more/less goods/services with the same resources
- Producing the same good/services with fewer/more resources
- Effciency/inefficiency
- More with less/less with more

### Production Function

- Measures productivity (and [[#Diminishing Marginal Returns]])
- Marginal product ($mP = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta L}$) (just like marginal utility; $Q$ is output, $L$ is change in input/labor)

### Product

#### Marginal Product
$$mP = \frac{\Delta Total Product}{\Delta Labor Output}$$

#### Average Product (Labor Productivity)
$$\overline{P} = \frac{Total Product}{Units of Labor}$$

#### Total Product
$TP$. Total quantity/output of a good/service.

### Diminishing Marginal Returns
> Too many cooks in the kitchen!

- As inputs increase, over time there becomes an excess
- Overcrowding, shortage of other resources
- With employees, some may just be standing around, and thus marginal returns decrease after a certain threshold
- Marginal product decreases, and at some point additional labor will decrease total product (cost exceeds production)
- Fixed technology (captial), variable resource (IV, commonly *labor*)
- Having multiple variable resources results in decreasing output
- Initially concave up, but after a certain point it becomes concave down
- Where average product intersects marginal product, that is the relative maximum
