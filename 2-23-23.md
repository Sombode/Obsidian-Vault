# Elasticity of Demand
How responsive people are (demand) to a change in price.

When the demand is very sensitive to price, then the demand is *elastic*. If demand is not sensitive, demand is *inelastic*. 

## Factors Affecting Elasticity
- The more substitutes exist, the more sensitive (elastic) people are (there are better alternatives)
- The more something costs (the larger the percentage of one's income), the more elastic demand is
- The more time people have to adjust to changing prices, the more elastic demand is (people get a better feel of the price, and possible savings later on; people in a rush will be less elastic)
- Luxuries are more elastic, necesities are more inelastic
- Narrow classifications (specific item) are more elastic, broader classifications are more inelastic (tomatoes vs food)

## Elasticity Coefficient
$$E_D=\frac{\%\Delta Q_D}{\%\Delta P}$$
$$E_D=\frac{\frac{\Delta Q_D}{(\frac{Q_1+Q_2}{2})}}{\frac{\Delta P}{(\frac{P_1+P_2}{2})}}$$
*Second equation accounts for the change in percentages when it comes to varying bases*

Similar to the slope of the demand curve, but is not as constant. Price is the IV.
