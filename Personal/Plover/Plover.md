Plover is a way of using QWERTY keyboards to simulate a stenograph.

While it lacks many letters, words are *generally* spelled phonetically, and words are typed by "chording" (pressing down a combination of letters all at once).

The left side (of the * key) is generally for the beginning of syllables, the right for the end.

# Vowels

## Short Vowels

Short vowels by themselves (no adjoining vowels) are always typed with their corresponding glyph (not the one that corresponds to its sound).
- not = o
- purse = u

Consecutive vowel sounds require the glyph with the matching short vowel sound.
- heart = a
- roar = o
- tough = u
## Long Vowels



## Diphthongs

# Briefs

Briefs are shortcuts for typing longer words.
