Plover is a way of using QWERTY keyboards to simulate a stenograph.

While it lacks many letters, words are *generally* spelled phonetically, and words are typed by "chording" (pressing down a combination of letters all at once).

*Plover remaps*

The left side (of the * key) is generally for the beginning of syllables, the right for the end.

#### Layout Mnemonic

Top left - STPH (Steph)
Bottom Left - SKWR (Skewer)

Vowels - AO EU (A *jump* E *I* O *jump* U)

Right Col 1 - FR (fr fr)
Right Col 2 - PB (peanut butter)
Right Col 3 - LG (leg)
Right Col 4 - TS (entices)
Right Col 5 - DZ (doesn't)

*^ VERY IMPORTANT*

The way/sequence characters are laid down once chorded
> Some exceptions do exist, called "inversions," for specific cases where it makes life easier without blocking other words

If S comes before another letter, use F instead.



# Vowels

## Short Vowels

Short vowels by themselves (no adjoining vowels) are always typed with their corresponding glyph (not the one that corresponds to its sound).
- not = o
- purse = u

Consecutive vowel sounds require the glyph with the matching short vowel sound.
- heart = a
- roar = o
- tough = u

"I" is chorded with EU
## Long Vowels

AEU for long a (grape, saint)
AOE for ee (seen, preach)
AOEU for i (guise, spite)
OE for oh (boat, grown)
AOU for oo (glue, NO "oo" IN WORD), ew (few)

## Diphthongs

AU for aw (bought, tawny, faun)
OU for ow (down, mound)
OEU or oi (toil, ploy)

## Vowel Disambiguation

*Some words can sound very similar but have different vowels, these remedy that.*

AE for homonyms where one is spelled with "ea"
> If neither has it, but one has at least an "a" and "e," use AE

AO for words with "oo" or words with the "o" sound (from O or OE) but spelled with "oa"

# Briefs

Briefs are shortcuts for typing longer words.
