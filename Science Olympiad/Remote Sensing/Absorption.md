As [[Electromagnetic Waves]] travel, they generally lose energy as certain wavelengths are absorbed. Solar radiation is commonly absorbed by water vapor, carbon dioxide, and ozone. Due to this, only specific ranges of wavelengths is clear enough (not absorbed) to be used in remote sensing, known as **atmospheric windows**.
