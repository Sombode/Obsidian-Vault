A blackbody is a hypothetical radiator/object that fully absorbs and reemits all incident energy (albedo of 0, transmission of 0, absorption of 1, reflection of 0). Often used to model objects (stars, planets) or other objects in mathematical equations to simplify things. Opposite of a [[Whitebody]], where all incident rays are completely reflected evenly.
