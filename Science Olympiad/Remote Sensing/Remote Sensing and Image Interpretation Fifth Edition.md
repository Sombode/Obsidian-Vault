# Chapter 1: Concepts and Foundation of Remote Sensing

Remote sensing is the act of perceiving an object, event, or occurrence without directly contacting it. This comes in the form of data, and for most purposes of remote sensing this data pertains to [[Electromagnetic Waves]] (EMW). Remote sensing comes in two main parts, *data acquisition* and *data analysis*. EMWs 1. come from a source 2. propagate through the atmosphere 3. hit and interact with Earth surface features 4. retransmit through the atmosphere 5. are captured by sensing systems 6. are converted to sensor data 7. and are compiled into maps, files, or other layers of information in a *geographic information system* (GIS).

Sensors can be either **passive** or **active**, with passive sensors simply absorbing incident EMWs, while active sensors supply their own energy to illuminate their subject (such as a camera flash).

All detected radiation travels a certain distance (or *path length*). Reflected sunlight must pass twice through the atmosphere, while naturally radiated thermal energy only passes once. The path length has an effect on the magnitude of the sensed energy. This is in part due to [[Scattering]] and [[Absorption]].
